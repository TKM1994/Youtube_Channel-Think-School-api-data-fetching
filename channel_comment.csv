86,hHGlDhJkDKI,"I would like to share my dilemma here and I am pretty sure that perhaps it&#39;s the same with a lot of people. Today, the e-commerce sites sell various products at prices cheaper than the local brick and mortar stores. So, most of us end up buying those things online. Whereas the business for these small stores are diminishing by the day and they are downing the shutters. A classic example would be the bookstores. Nowadays any title is available at a higher discount at any online site. So its completely reasonable from the customer point of view to buy them online. But business for these small stores are also important and as accentuated by this video, they need to be supported. Would be very interesting to know to your thoughts and views on this.",

Branding with conscience is essential. <br>If Volvo keeps up the good work,  we can at our level can also follow such principles.

310,A1k62pSQ7so,These selling concepts are applicable in lower-income countries as I see some advertisements for washing powders in Vietnam are sold from 5000 dong which is $0.22 in USD which caters the need of the large customer base of Vietnamese families from a lower income category. It is hardly seen in high developed countries as most of them are affordable to buy in bottles and factories are willing to produce so to support the fixed costs in economies of scale.,
311,A1k62pSQ7so,Isn&#39;t that case is just opposite with the brands like Cadbury they increase the amount of the chocolate with increase in its price. Like five rupees of chocolate have lesser amount than eighty rupees of chocolate. And they make more profit in small packets than large.,
312,A1k62pSQ7so,You missed the main point here is that Bcoz of Chik shampoo  inroduced 50 paisa shampoo then all companies came down they also started giving 50 paisa  1 rupee shampoo sachets that much success chik got but the great thing is still they are providing that 50 paisa shampoo even though all brands little bit increased and one more thing is that  before chik shampoo brand came into the market already  sachets  were available but cost is high all shampoo  brands sachets starts from 1.50 paisa to 3 Rs  i remember bcoz till it comes we were using soap nuts due to big  family but chik helped many families <br>Don&#39;t miss the main points next time,
313,A1k62pSQ7so,"Gem,you are a gem bro !",

They must invest in large sources of renewable energy alternatives such as huge solar panels on the government lands... Generate the power and distribute it according to their costs... Also for farms and lands with substantial area, the governments can rationalise the cost of installation over 5 years and reduce their load on say as much as they can... Of course the consumption is to be charged and it is only the fixed installment that has to be equated... This is suitable for almost every person depending on the size of consumption ...

341,A1k62pSQ7so,Thanks,
342,A1k62pSQ7so,"It&#39;s totally wrong info. The concept was founded by CK Ranganatgan father but &quot;Chik&quot; shampoo was not the brand. The actual brand name is &quot;Velvette&quot; he invented the Lathe machine where he took the garden hose pipe and made the Sachet out of it. After his father&#39;s death, CKR started his own company Cavinkare and his brother still run the Velvette international. Ratan Tata jest before his retirement as chairman visited velvette International office in chennai to pay homage of this inventor. Kindly do proper research, just like that do not change the history. This is the problem with you north Indians, where you throw a story which you think sensational about South Indian Co without doing any research. 🤦‍♀️",

345,A1k62pSQ7so,I love you knowledge &amp; energy to explore..,
346,A1k62pSQ7so,But guys we need to remember how sachets badly affect the environment. as we know plastic can&#39;t decompose and earlier 1 plastic 100ml bottle has now become 20-30 sachets which is much more plastic and really bad for the environment.,
347,A1k62pSQ7so,Still remember 1/2 rupee chik shampoo,
348,A1k62pSQ7so,your videos are good. you should make video in hindi,
349,A1k62pSQ7so,Thanks,
350,A1k62pSQ7so,"Great Analysis..<br>I used to work for a top player in FMCG market u mentioned in this video<br>Couple more points to add here.. <br>Actually the customers end up using more product per wash when they buy a bigger bottle. They cannot accurately dispense 5 mL. They end up sqeezing 7-8 mL. Sachet is the minimum quantity required to deliver the result. Hence, the profit is quite huge for the company when they buy a bottle.<br>Another one, when u look at an ad of a toothpaste, they show sqeezing the toothpaste along the whole length of the brush. In reality, according to internal studies..we just need peanut size globule  to get the desired efficacy of cleaning.<br><br>Just wanted to add to ur analysis.<br>Great work, keep going!",
351,A1k62pSQ7so,"Please<br><br>That company made money, but to clean the litterings tax payers money has been spent to remove the Strom water drain clogs, even chocolate companies too.<br><br>If that is smart idea then scam and cheat is also smart",

366,A1k62pSQ7so,Can you please do a video on zilingo ?,
367,A1k62pSQ7so,Undoubtedly great video... but we need to keep this in mind that small packs or pouches always create more pollution then big packs...<br>For eg. Small maggie pack has 5grm of plastic but larger has inspite of 20grm (5×4=20) only has 15-18 grms... so try to buy large packs of atleast FMCG products.<br>Or 2nd option is to go green and buy eco friendly products,

407,-NtB3rf8paE,I am a great fan of all your work. I used to follow all your videos. But only things that work opposite to case study is zomato. Its keep on falling .,
408,-NtB3rf8paE,"these food delivery app have raised huge fund from chinese companies, where they may have internal pressure to handle in this way and follow chinas debt trap in local business as govt is not accepting. comming to food delivery both swiggy and zomato has raised their commision on both hotel and custumer end its better to get it from hotel other then ordering from app. now a days there are few frauds done by delivery boys using latest cancellation policy.",
409,-NtB3rf8paE,Zomato has no pics for food items that are sold by restaurants listed on zomato...this problem keeps me away from ordering on zomato..,
410,-NtB3rf8paE,Thanks siirr,
411,-NtB3rf8paE,"This video appears to be sponsored. I always had high regards for the content and neutral opinion of your topics, but this is biased video. Further, All the non core investments which zomato is doing...infact conflict of interest with Mr goyals personal investments too. The capital markets are a great leveler. All the people cannot be fooled All the time!!!",
412,-NtB3rf8paE,Zomato will run its business untill its investors money left in their account. They dont have sustainable business model. Good if they prove it wrong. Atleast investor money gets saved.,
413,-NtB3rf8paE,"I would like to add some points as a delivery person with Zomato.<br>I have delivered food to a person in a remote location 12 km away from the restaurant ordered from her daughter in a foreign location at the peak time. Is it possible for any restaurant to do the same I don&#39;t think so.<br>Don&#39;t forget birthday cakes. Sweets and other goodies delivered to your loved ones via Zomato in less than two hours times was it possible before.<br>The payment may not be good but it provides employment opportunity to anyone and flexibility to work at your convenient was this type of work possible before no it was not.<br>A newly opened restaurant has access to different customer in 12 km ratio of the location, the restaurant can be a cloud kitchen &amp; could be located in a remote location . They don&#39;t have to look after any supply ,as  Zomato with supplied them all the raw materials.<br>It could be a lazy Sunday morning or a busy day at the work, no matter the price we are all going to fire up the app to get the food delivered at the house from any restaurant listed.<br>Obviously Zomato or swiggy model is here to stay and nothing will stop them from profitability",
414,-NtB3rf8paE,Hi.. wasn&#39;t ITC planning something similar ?,
415,-NtB3rf8paE,Hard to beat Swiggy though!,
416,-NtB3rf8paE,Another bullshit.<br>U don’t know the reality.<br>There is no way u can get inventory management in raw material for restaurants.<br>I think u r living in an imaginary world.<br>After I saw ur Bharat pe video I am 100% sure that ur research is bullshit.<br>Bharat pe’s model is also failing because of fraudulent business model.<br><br>So please stop feeding bullshit.,
417,-NtB3rf8paE,"As there are multiple types of raw materials and needs different types of strategies for procuring, this won&#39;t be easy.  As the local suppliers have different strategies.  It seems that the philosophy is only good on papers.",
418,-NtB3rf8paE,Getting groceries from Zomato by restaurant is easy but payment by restaurant to Zomato is very big question <br>I think it will work for people to buy at basic rates like getting groceries at less prices not for restaurant s,
419,-NtB3rf8paE,UR awesome presenter,
420,-NtB3rf8paE,"they will fail spectacularly, reliance is angling at the same.",
421,-NtB3rf8paE,"Zomato is a business... Which is trying to make profit. That doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s a bad thing. For gods sake, they are a business. <br><br>They are not making you buy food forcefully. It&#39;s a democratic system. You order food if you want. otherwise don&#39;t. <br><br><br>And video - &quot;Zomato exposed&quot; Like they are doing something wrong. <br><br><br>You are making your bread and butter by making a video on them. So let&#39;s respect everyone. Cause making such a big business and nailking it.... Is a big thing and very very hard.",
422,-NtB3rf8paE,"Zomato is going to have to invest a lot more when it comes to contracting farm hands and farm lands. Most of them are already being invested in other companies like Aashirvaad, MDH, MORE etc. It&#39;s not going to be easy competing with them. On the other hand, a company like MDH or Elite can easily start a Zomato variant.",

428,-NtB3rf8paE,"This is way better, simpler, practical and to the point than the boring outdated case study sessions I had during my full time MBA in NMIMS Mumbai. I had learnt zero from my whole MBA case study sessions spread over 2 years, whereas just one video of think school has given so much! Even the paid promotion seems worth thinking about",

434,-NtB3rf8paE,are we just going to play with retail and logistics as most startups are doing in India or should we look forward to some groundbreaking technology startups?,
435,-NtB3rf8paE,Ii am restaurant owner 43% of my revenue is eaten by Zomato as advertising cost and commission but still it is not profitable. I order very few items from Zomato less than 15% of my inventory purchase because there is bonding with old suppliers and it is hard to break with them as of now they are giving us a little discount after acquiring the market they will increase price as these big giant companies are not trustworthy as they did with commissions earlier is used to give 12% as commissions now 28%+gst and advertising cost also. They are giving some items in low cost but buying whole from them is not good we have seen them at charging commissions.,
436,-NtB3rf8paE,jaroor doobega,
437,-NtB3rf8paE,Zomato is creating a supply chain for dominating the food market.<br>This plan is something like Amazon.<br>If it worked the investment will return a lot.,
438,-NtB3rf8paE,Hyperpure has good products. I order daily for our restaurant bhojanyan. Only issue is about the delivery time. 70% of the time deliveries are late but you get a good rate plus good product.,
439,-NtB3rf8paE,Hi ..<br>Can you suggest any website where we can read good and deep case study,
440,-NtB3rf8paE,"You are amezing, I am doing my MBA from marketing and I have to read different case studies. Your channel helped me alot for making notes and analysing market.. thanks you are doing great Job",
441,-NtB3rf8paE,That’s why Mr. Modi had come up with Farm bill to enable contract farming. But sadly it couldn’t reach to farmers coz of dirty politics!,
442,-NtB3rf8paE,i just bought 6 shares of zomato,
443,-NtB3rf8paE,Well edited video. Loved it!,
444,-NtB3rf8paE,News flash : hyperpure has shut down !  🤣,
445,-NtB3rf8paE,"Zomate share breakout in next week....will touch 180,buy maximum share..",
446,-NtB3rf8paE,"Support local vendors in Bangalore, throw these companies out.",
447,-NtB3rf8paE,All bullshit. It will not work in the way he is explaining.,
448,-NtB3rf8paE,We have 5-6 mutton vendors based on quality . So if every (most) restaurant gets ingredients from one vendors quality and taste will not enhance.,
449,-NtB3rf8paE,Awesome Brother 💝<br>Thank you so much for Awesome Motivation.........,
450,-NtB3rf8paE,This guy is doing what no fucking school is doing giving valuable knowledge and creating leaders,
451,-NtB3rf8paE,"over ambitious, already they are killing restaurants by partnership and giving pennies to delivery partners....",
452,-NtB3rf8paE,Please make timestamps too,
453,-NtB3rf8paE,"hello guys <br>I have a doubt, what will zomato do if there is some kind of natural disaster and all the yield that the farmer has grown was destroyed? Since they will be paying a small amount to the farmers in the beginning will it not be a hitback to them again?<br>thank you",
454,-NtB3rf8paE,Zomato is to early to IPO,
455,-NtB3rf8paE,"Borosil Renewables Wow, I have already purchased when it was trading @Price of 40 per share,<br>And still holding it",
456,-NtB3rf8paE,Eventually at the end The supply of raw material through Zomato hyperpure will be based on farming. A bad year or a bad season and who know that Zomato doesn&#39;t able to supply on time. And if the restaurant have only one supplier so as to minimise the default or late payment - they will suffer massively due to the uneven supply,
457,-NtB3rf8paE,"Buddy, you changed my perspective. Next time when I&#39;m ordering on zomato, I&#39;ll definitely be thinking more about the restaurant I&#39;m ordering from.",
458,-NtB3rf8paE,The zomato IPO was a sham .. and so many of the startup IPOs are looking like that.. These startups dont have any feasible plan on becoming profitable after taking millions and billions in VC money. But what they do get is high valuation just becasue they are talked about so much. Hence now we see the investors are getting back their money through the public which put in money for the IPO. Foreign investors getting their money back at Indian public risk.. seems like something is wrong here,
459,-NtB3rf8paE,"Metro is also in the same space from quite some time. How is Zomato going to face Metro, reliance, future and Tata Big Basket.",
460,-NtB3rf8paE,Hey Mr.Ganesh Prasad I just want to know how did you find adani power as interesting stock? Do you know it has debt of 39000cr and the other thing is that adani power operates in mumbai and in mumbai tier - 3 areas people does not pay bill when adani power tries to cut down power supply people will protest and the government supports local people and then adani power has to start power supply in the promise of government and in this way they loosing 100s of crore bussiness....If you already know these negative points I want to know how did you find adani power as intresting !

477,-NtB3rf8paE,I have used Hyperpure. Its really good but the return policy or product mismatch policy horrible. They litterally misbehave for even small amount like 200 - 300. But apart from that its supply is good need little more expansion. Thanks Think school for all the insights that you provide on regular basis.,
478,-NtB3rf8paE,"Contract farming is the key to success for this farm to fork model,let&#39;s see Zomato is conscious about this when they already have climate consciousness",

489,-NtB3rf8paE,Hi Ganesh.The video is beautifully edited.Just wanted to ask do you edit them by yourself or have you hired an editor?,
490,-NtB3rf8paE,It&#39;s a  very challenging idea,

497,-NtB3rf8paE,please do a case study on patel brother&#39;s . ( its a giant in the indian grocery market sector in US),
498,-NtB3rf8paE,"Broad illustration.<br>Agree - Scale &amp; certainty in farm to fork captured by hyperpure by there AI will help them to create profit from normal 3-5% to 10-12%.<br>BUT <br>What about <br>-Taxes,<br>-Logistics (B2B-Farm to Storage to Business, Do Zomato have that ?)<br>-Perishable item loss.",
499,-NtB3rf8paE,"Ganesh - As usual, very good information you provided in your video. Great man, keep up the good work in educating common people like me. My question is what if Swiggy or Amazon or any new company come up with super pumped PE money and give discounts more than Zomato. See you need to understand one point, Zomato already went public and it is under tremendous pressure to perform. Zomato Hyperpure is directly linked to delivery where restaurants are associated with them. With new companies providing more discounts, people can move to new players and so as restaurants. If it happens then what is the motivation for a restaurant owner to stick to Zomato delivery and their Hyperpure? My next question is Zomato taking some stake in Curefit - Dont you think a capital (?? i mean PE money) misallocation? Infoedge started investments in start-ups in early 2010 from the cash proceeds/profits but Zomato is taking public money and investing in different start-up where those companies can go bust. Pls share your feedback on these 2 questions. Thanks, Dara - u r channel followe from Oslo.",

585,wzsYAuxhxSw,People like my parents had to buy the merch then they had to convince the people to use the product. They bought the sales meeting tickets for other people just to listen the seminar which cost them around 400-700 Rs  per person.

696,h7xd2PqtglQ,"Nicely covered though the entire story, just one correction, at the time of ban CPO exports was also banned. Please be double assure as this leads to misleading statements.",
697,h7xd2PqtglQ,"Actually a little bit wrong but the gist of it is right. Region of heavy palm oil producers are Sumatra and Kalimantan. The consumers are mainly in java and sumatra. The big problem why the price shot up is cartelism between palm oil companies which are dominated by few companies, which are trying to get as many profit as possible when the price shot up just before ramadan (high consumption period). So the government under pressure of the public banned the export. Miraculously the supply return to normal afterward.",
698,h7xd2PqtglQ,A,
699,h7xd2PqtglQ,"Indonesia palm oil farm is concentrated in Sumatra and Kalimantan island. <br>Problem of rising palm oil price was not due to inconnectivity between island, but  due to greedyness of palm oil factory oligarchs, corruptive government, mismanagement, and top leadership policy.<br>All palm oil company has Public Service Obligation (PSO) to domestic market (Indonesia market first). But they violated as sky rocketing price outside country (import) had blinded their eye and hearth as well as erase normal logical thingking by selling all palm oil stock outisde country and forgeting the PSO.<br>High price palm oil was also benefiting to palm farmer. But banning on export palm oil product suddently plunged down palm fruit price and suffering the farmer. Meanwhile it like pairy tale story for oligarch as they buy palm fruit very cheap but sell the palm oil very high, because gov still allow to exporting crude palm oil...a crazy and blunder  policy in the middle of high palm cooking oil in the country",

805,SGIKsejp7-0,"honestly, there is vast difference if you use a Gillette Mach 3 and a Gillette Fusion. I get very thick beard and so can tell. Mostly when you want a closer chave against the grain which most blades are unable to do including Dollar Shave or it&#39;s Indian counterpart Bombay Shaving Company. Gillette is superbly smooth and hold true to their ad &quot;Shave ulti karein ya seedhi&quot;. <br><br>Gillette does sell razors atbdircheap but blades at high price but if you compare a Gillette blade with a similar blade of a different brand, Gillette does last longer. And mind you, there is no alternative to Gillette Fusion (5-6 blades)",

813,SGIKsejp7-0,There is a Gillette woke commercial that made many shift . I know 3 people shit from Gillette after commercial.,
814,SGIKsejp7-0,"It was more of a woke driven suicide by Gillette. Having made a fortune off bearded men over decades, Gillette thought it fit to lecture those very fund providers on their &quot;toxicity&quot;.

826,SGIKsejp7-0,"Also Gillette spat on the face of their target customers in the name of wokeism. That lost them a lot of customers. Many switched to DSC and others, like me, to a safety razor.",
827,SGIKsejp7-0,"Hi.  Like the moral of your story. I am sooo happy Gillette is dying. P&amp;G has a dirty marketing strategy of killing other brands. When I understood Gillettes way of clearing out other brands from the shelves and forcing the user to make them rich; I stopped buying Gillette.  When ethics are compromised,  life is short!!!.

842,SGIKsejp7-0,Gillette learnt it the hard way  &quot;everything woke turns to shit&quot;,
843,SGIKsejp7-0,I stopped buying any Gillette products after their stupid woke culture commercials.  Gillette lost a large part of their market share due to their stupid commercials.  Other companies produce a good product without preaching woke ideas to men who just want a good razor.,
844,SGIKsejp7-0,"They&#39;ve dug themselves so deep with that &quot;Toxic masculinity&quot; commercial that they&#39;re never getting out of it. Dollar and many other brands were waiting for the opportunity to disrupt gillette market share, that Gillette themselves gave them, and they took it. Customers aren&#39;t stupid.",
845,SGIKsejp7-0,U r just doing amazing work and research... Really learnt alot from your videos. Just a suggestion make your videos in hindi as well to reach more audience and offcourse many people will learn new things. With such a huge population knowing Hindi u can reach out larger public &amp; its worth it,

859,SGIKsejp7-0,Superb content👏👏👏,
860,SGIKsejp7-0,"Did you intentionally ignored the fact that sales and reputation of Gillette stooped low significantly after publishing a woke &quot;toxic-masculinity&quot; ad in 2019? There was even a global boycott Gillette movement, DSC along other razor companies benefitted greatly during this time since customers began to look for alternatives. The biggest business lesson is &quot;Go woke get broke&quot;",
861,SGIKsejp7-0,"I beat both Gillette and DSC. Bought a traditional cut throat razor at INR 275 (about $ 3.5) - a one time investment - and a pack of 50 two-sided blades for INR 150 ($2) which would last to eternity. My shaving ritual, twice a weak, starts with a tumbler of hot water, a white napkin, an ordinary shaving cream and a concave mirror. I turn on a classical tune on mobile (and loud on the music system when the wifey is not around!!!) and soak the face, apply leather and the razor glides like a knife through butter. Had a few cuts initially, but got perfection after a month of usage. Takes longer, 20 minutes or so, but I get a super shave while the music ends.       😇",
862,SGIKsejp7-0,"Someone gifted me a Turbo Mach 3 razor about 2 years ago. When I asked for a replacement  for my worn out one, they quoted an obscene amount. I switched back to the good old razor which uses safety blades. I am convinced that this is more economical since it has four sharp edges compared to the one of the much advertised Gillette&#39;s. The gifted one has been lying there in the box ever since.",
863,SGIKsejp7-0,The lesson that I learned is that there is nothing like &quot;Customer loyalty&quot;. They will turn to somewhere else as soon as they find a better option.,
864,SGIKsejp7-0,"Awesome, also I think the future is going to be Trimmers, there is a definite behavioral shift towards it. I started with Gillette and continued until I started using trimmers and I have not shaved in 5 years, only use trimmers now. The last I shaved was on my wedding day.",
865,SGIKsejp7-0,"As a wise man once said, &quot;Everything woke, turns to shit&quot;<br><br>Gillette got the taste of hiring gender neutral, oppressed, compressed, bench-pressed left-capitalism hating wokes as brand managers and I am just sipping the tears from their downfall. I wish they either go back to basics, issue an apology or disappear completely.",
866,SGIKsejp7-0,Why don&#39;t you put such videos as a podcast??,
867,SGIKsejp7-0,"Gillette went Woke and<br>The Toxic masculinity ad killed them ,simple",

Be clear, concise and short &amp; sweet., This concept is very very very easily be explained in under 4 mins. Don&#39;t stretch and bore.

875,SGIKsejp7-0,Iam vexed with the stranglehold Gillette has on the shaving product market and have been looking for an alternative.

Theodore Levitt in his amazing paper ‘Myopic Marketing’ published in 1960 summed it up in one line ‘Customer doesn’t need a quarter inch drill, he needs a quarter inch hole.’  He pointed out that companies are obsessed with improving their product(drill) and forget the basic purpose and need of the end client. This is an open secret/lesson… but despite this paper being 60 years old it’s still difficult to implement.",

963,5JKTbU6RnA0,"Difference between the problems of India and Ireland are fundamental.... while Ireland had ppl leaving, India is seeing population explosion due to mindless breeding of it&#39;s ppl. There are already too many engineering graduates produced in India with majority of them unemployable. Moreover, ministers in India want it&#39;s people to remain half educated so that they don&#39;t question their judgement. Only thing that can save India is ruthless population control and mass employment generating industries like textile, mfg etc..",
964,5JKTbU6RnA0,The first change we should adopt to our education system which is a must is to give compulsory science &amp; maths education till +2 rather than till std 10 irrespective of marks or interest. Already we have aptitude exams after +2 to choose which streams one want. So the logic of not continuing science &amp; maths is bizarre. Though it&#39;s just two years of extra science &amp; maths the change will be phenomenol &amp; path breaking. Our education &amp; career choices will be much more pronounced &amp; unforced. Ponder over it.,
965,5JKTbU6RnA0,CBSE is becoming more and more outdated.students basics are not deep rooted because of very poor description in textbook and education in India is not qualitative  rather focuses on quantitative results.,

970,5JKTbU6RnA0,"I always thought that Indian education system is not worth my knowledge my time and money. As an open category student that time was very tough to secure a good college. Somehow I got admitted into an average college. But due to unfortunate events and critical condition of my family I had to compromise and I started working. It was full time 9-10 hrs work. After few years I had enough savings to finish my education. I passed in first class. Our college had no campus interviews. So i had to look on my own. I used to clear all rounds except the HR round where my academics was questioned due to the gap I had. And when I told them about it they use to ask me to do what I was doing earlier and this happend with all those companies where I interviewed. Even after doing passing in first grade clearing all rounds I was rejected on the basis of Gap I had and the work ai did during that Gap. My moral was all time down. But I had no option to find a solution and move on. I joined a startup consultancy firm and all was going good untill pandemic hit India. And that firm shutdown and again I was left with nothing but to wait and watch to get the situation normalised. But instead it was getting more worse and I had very few savings remaining. I had no work for months I then came across webcam modeling and became cam model. But this was very temporary and I knew I wudn&#39;t survive on it for long run. So meanwhile I started looking for other options. And I came across one luckily. I studied and did research on it for almost two years. And launched my own brand. Now I am working full time for my own brand and it&#39;s growing. Our education system failed to acknowledge my talent hence I had to do it on my own. I bet there  are so many people like me who deserves better but have to compromise due to this system. All I can say is Struggle is still on but what I learnt through all this year&#39;s, hardly any Indian University wud have taught me and I am still learning and growing. 😇✌️<br>And yes thanks for this video very informative and I really appreciate your detailed analysis. Keep up the good work. 👍 ❤️",

How ever the people are more than oversmart in our great nation india...they just want to gulp every thing while asking increase the population only fir votebank...we can only end up in worst of nations...with this population growth...in addition to it lot of discrimination at every level...that fills the filth in the society with hell of barricades.....needed a gate crashing approach to all this dogmas and pitfalls...",

974,5JKTbU6RnA0,I was surprised that my engineering degree did not help me in my job. I had to relearn everything for my job and would suggest engineering students not to avoid professional certificates before graduating. A friend who went abroad for studies went couple of months in advance so that he can study and acclimate to new structure. It costed him a bomb but he states that it helped immensely. He passed out of uni with recognition.,

You don&#39;t have the basic knowledge of what an actual tech hub is. <br>   Secondly to be rich and have high per capita income is how the western empire have defined development according to their perspective. <br>     We Indians have a far higher sence and far reacher perspective than them and gradually the world will come to know of that. The so called western empire is on the verge of crumbling. <br>Ireland which is also part of UK is going through a major economic crisis and probably their have their golden days left behind. <br>So believe in your country , your contries people, their achievements and in their future. Each country is unique and so are their education system. <br>We definitely need reforms in our education system, but according to our countries need and in our perspective. <br>We need not to follow blindly their education system. It&#39;s like using fairness cream to make our skin tone like them. It&#39;s a sickening mentality. This sickening mentality in today&#39;s youth proves how faulty our education system has been. First we need that education that builds our character and confidence in ourselves and helps to get off the colonial yoke from our shoulder.",
989,5JKTbU6RnA0,India has far better options than the Irish system. The well proven system given by Sathya Sai Baba is called Educare. It is in progress and in schools from KG to PG for over 30 years now. Might want to take a look at that.,

1019,BiO2WRPBzSA,If atleast 10% of people with money to invest can put solar on their home and power their own house and office . I am sure these issues can be fixed. National governemnt is giving subsidy of 50% like 25000rs for 1 kw subsidy so 1kw only costs 25k rs.

1129,0wVAPXswE6E,"Toyota a family name even in India has class which ford lacks in the Indian market. <br>JIT concepts need discipline and long term contracts where the supply chain operations has to be perfected. <br>It is not simply assembly in the factory. Without inventory,  and only for 15 days is serious logistical issue where India needs to focus. <br>The behind stories and corrupt selection of vendors in US and Europe led to Japanese rise. <br>Saving the capital or labor is still important in tech world as the cost reaches high and inflation ensures operational model has to be lean.<br>The question is can Indian brands follow the model. <br>Chennai the auto hub has well connected tier 1 and 2  suppliers where it is still possible to run efficient assembly line. <br>But clogged ports and highways are a problem. Customs protocol of getting sub assemblies from other states is rather tough. <br>Hence Indian SEZs should build all supply chain around each other to save costs and labor. Clusters are good enough,  like one in Coimbatore for electronic assemblies.",

It&#39;s a great mistake they have not bring their Ford galaxy in Indian market and then endeavour. A Ford car owner will be a Full satisfied owner. 20 00  buy Toyota qualis and then Ford ikon now ecosport titanium.

I have been using WD-40 since 2015 and have found no worthy competitor to this great product.",

1368,cbTEAeteaI8,Pidilite has also acquired ( joint venture) ICA that&#39;s a leading wooden coating brand all over Europe and every architects choice in India aswell.,
1369,cbTEAeteaI8,The brand name Fevicol or similar product brand like Adeldrite... Are clear examples where the brand name or logo holds just a small importance over so many other factors like <br>Coustomer handling and marketing<br>User feedback. <br>Product Research and development<br>Quality consistency <br>And advertisement<br>One needs to ask themselves.. names like fevicol or Adeldrite to its end users might not be know or recognised but it&#39;s mostly uneducated  advocates in form of Carpenters and masonry and so enticed by this brands that they do the bulk load of pulling the advertisement loads by mouth publicity.,

1378,cbTEAeteaI8,"The way you put your opinion regarding the company, is unmatched. Thanks such a great vdo.",
1379,cbTEAeteaI8,The thing is they have penetrated so deeply in our minds that even when we go to shops we won&#39;t be asking Glue/Adhesive we will say give me &#39;Fevicol&#39;,

I am just an ordinary Facebook user i use iphone , now everyone knows iphone privacy policies we get one extra ordinary feature which is ‘’ASK APP TO NOT TRACK’’ this is where problem has being started I chose this feature at that time so many other users like me who chose to not share their data with Facebook and now Facebook simply stop me to login into my account only with Facebook app but if i use other devices like my pC my other phone i am able to access, now so many of you might think that must be just another bug that must be fixes somehow by reinstalling resetting iphone or updating firmware, believe me guys I even tried to install fb forcefully with 3rd party softwares using PC but still nothing happn.

1642,eLT1To94V-Q,"I don&#39;t think it will work because people have loyalty brand to brand. Some prefer tata in cars while the same person will prefer different jewellery brand.

1650,eLT1To94V-Q,"I am going to say few things that many people may not like. Tata group companies are not the best. As an IT professional I can see tcs is not a good company. Tata motors doesn&#39;t provide good services after purchase. And tata neu predecessor of tata cliq is a bad app. Don&#39;t believe me? Go open the app and try to purchase a tshirt. If you don&#39;t know your size for that brand, usually you will open a size guide and get an idea. In tata app everything is wrong in size guide. I am speaking from my own experience. Now suppose you ordered tshirt anyway, the tracking of the order never works. For me it always showed it was dispatching, but item was already on my doorstep. We love Ratan Tata and I have deep respect for them. But after him this group is going down. <br><br>Also I did not get any neu points as a reward from my previous Croma purchases and tata cliq purchases.",

Many times I sent emails to the zerodha  statement email but it bounced back to me.

1664,eLT1To94V-Q,"The edge that TATA has over reliance and adani is the airlines. Tata offers 4 diffrent airlines to choose from. Air Asia India, Vistara, Air India and Air India express from which we can compare prices and also try to get the cheapest ticket fully discounted. This will be a major threat to airlines like indigo and spicejet. And also tata offers vacation packages with their hotels that include flight tickets and stay and tours. So life of a consumer becomes so much easier with this and looks attractive as well. It just takes away the tension of booking a seperate flight ticket and seperate hotel room and stuff. And also cancellation of flights are minimum to nil as integration between these 4 airlines gives a huge fleet spread where customers can be served by either one of them during an unfortunate cancellation in one airline",

1673,eLT1To94V-Q,"Great content Ganesh...<br>Want to point out some contrarian points here...<br>1)  Though this super app has huge potential, the current set of brands under most of the segments are not market leaders...for instance for flights there is Air Asia currently and Tata plans to bring Vistara and Air India in coming future but if you think about it without Indigo Spice Jet and GoAir , having the flights section would not serve any major purpose<br><br>2) Within hotels there are only 5 star hotels  of the Taj brand which would not cater to the mass market of Indian population and therefore the hotels section becomes a very dud use case<br><br>3) Fashion wise Tata Cliq is behind players like Nykaa and Myntra and with Nykaa offering personalised experiences to users, it would be difficult to say that a lot of users would flock to this super app for fashion purchases..<br><br>Let me know your thoughts and thank you so much for sharing the materials for understanding super apps..",
1674,eLT1To94V-Q,Just a 💎gem,
1675,eLT1To94V-Q,One my suggestion  to them . In our india almost 40% illiterate people they are even now how to use all of this .  They are go to local purchase.  This is big challenge to super apps.  Since from  last 80 years stock market is running How many people now about of stock market . Don&#39;t compair with other countries to India bcoz Indian studys only for rich peoples.  All govt employees and politicians are enjoying their life with poor people life.,

China is an authoritarian state.. and other apps gave its citizena freedom and exposure to democratic countries lifeatyle and news..this was not liked by China and hence it created wechat through which it controls its citizens and their thinking from the same app.. for a democracy this is not good.

Indian companies are just a product cycle management &amp; logistics company, focuses only on product appearance and brand establishment; Havells is better in this case, they at-least assembles in India.. mostly uses Chinese technology.. if they can compete in advanced countries like US, EU, China, that will prove their quality/uniqueness (indian auto/auto parts companies actually proved themselves)",

1831,RoD3kThcl6U,This is all bullshit and publicity stunt sponsored by the airlines owner. In the US and Europe a 1.5 hours flight costs 30 USD. Which is roughly 2200 RS. Whereas the promotional price of Akasa Air Mumbai Ahmedabad or Bangalore Cochin routes for 1.5 hours flight is 4000 RS. We need a really great business model for competing the business models of aviation in the West. Akasa is nothing ground breaking only that they would have saved money during aircraft purchase in Covid times. plus he bought Boeing 737 Max which is a highly unsafe model. Paisa jaan se Bada nahi hota hai....sorry I cannot travel in unsafe aircrafts at &quot;not a great discounted price&quot;. Better to continue with Spicejet Indigo Go Air or Air India...,

1845,RoD3kThcl6U,"Reading the comments show that the audience have not participated to the discussions at a business level. We want to learn from the experts out there. Big Bull (BB) is gone Raging Bull and a foolish ego to enter the Indian Aviation Market faced and facing numerous challenges. Namely aviation fuel costs, cut throat competition and cost of the choices of aircraft, range and type. AirAsia India (AAI) was doomed when it employed a non aviation CEOs for several years by the flamboyant Tony Fernandes and his crony friends from the music industry. AAI Route Planning and Slots were difficult and in short supply within the Metro Cities and Tier One Airports. Then there is the Aviation Market to regional Markets or International that requires operations for 5 years and a minimum of 15 aircraft. Aviation Fuel is so unpredictable with the war in Ukraine, DIFFICULT TO HEDGE and translates to ticket pricing affecting demand. Selling Tickets dependent on the Internet has limitations. Travel Agents are still have to be utilised in India for some years. BB has gone bananas as he has NO Experience in Aviation or Similar Industries where customer satisfaction are paramount. BB needs a Team that understands aviation.  Yeap. Cost Cutting is up to a point were the cost cutting contributes to negative value propositions. Then there is the question of setting up an MRO or outsourcing Not forgetting Start Up Costs of enormous investments. The Biggest Obstacle is the Indian Government Polices and Taxation. These are bug bears that holds back India in every way. Indian Government Policies are a JOKE.",
1846,RoD3kThcl6U,Wouldn&#39;t the tax increase if depreciation increases as EBIDTA increases?,

1851,RoD3kThcl6U,"As you mentioned Indigo takes back their aircraft on a lease term of upto 8 years, that would make the lease a Financial lease. So in a Financial lease all the risks and rewards of the Right to use asset are transferred to the lessee (here Indigo). Thus, the repair and maintenance of the aircrafts should be the responsibility of Indigo. (As per IND AS 17- Leases)",

1863,RoD3kThcl6U,You’re doing a noble job my friend.,
1864,RoD3kThcl6U,"Good video in principle. But there is a flaw in argument. When Indigo leases the aircraft, the lesser will take into account all cost the airplane will incur (running cost, maintenance, depreciation), plus profit. So operating the airplane in a sale - lease back approach is always costlier than if you would be the owner. The advantage, as you rightly point out, is that the cost are to be covered by the generated incomes, thus affecting cash-flow.<br>The other flaw in argument is that it increases the net profit. This is not always the case, as depreciation is always taken as an expense, reducing thus the gross profit before tax.",

Indigo has acted as a middle man now by selling.    My question- why the company (doing maintenance) not make purchases from Boeing directly to 50 million.  Why why buy it at 55 ?  Some thing fishy.

1906,X-CLMLrHcqU,"<b>History repeating like during WW2 and WW1/Spanish plague.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now under WW3 and a corona virus pandemic. Hitler used Zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the fumant removed.  It causes symptoms like corona virus.  Look up in the sky you will see planes spraying your cities!  Hitler attacked Russia, just like what is happening now.  The British Empire had no legal male Heir so they imported a fake one from Germany.  The British Queen&#39;s husband &quot;Prince Philip&quot; renounced his German citizenship, became a Greek citizen and as a Greek citizen moved to Britain gaining citizenship there.  After gaining citizenship, he was appointed a Duke, out of thin air and then as a Prince and married Queen Elizabeth.  &quot;Prince Philip&quot; took the name of the Queen, not the other way, as it usually is done, where a wife takes the husband&#39;s name.  The British Empire has run out of male Heirs at least twice, and they kill to suppress it.    WW2 was a way of hiding this fraud, and now WW3 is a way of hiding that illegal combines Heir. The Bible says that a male would not fail to sit on the throne.  A family name continues through the males, not the females, and Philip was a fraud.  He had become a Greek citizen to make it appear that he was a Royal from the earlier Greek dynasty.</b>  Total theater.  <b>The Catholic Empires of the Roman Empire form one leg and the UK(British controlled) Empire forms the other leg of the Roman Empire, with the King Pope Francis as the ruler of the whole system.  He has a triple teired crown with 666 on it in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  He is a King of the city state of the Vatican(the Vatican is the smallest Country in the world), Rome Italy, and is mentioned in Revelation, Apocalypse, 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions that this Empire is responsible for all those slaughtered on earth.  It mention what the leaders wear, which is scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  The UK leg Royals also wear those colors, a long with Judges and Magistrates of the Crown.  They refer to this entity as the Crown.  When some one goes to court in one of the British subservient Nations, it is said that the Crown has a case against the person.</b>  Canada, Australian and others are not sovereign or free.  please read Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, and study it closely, because this Empire comes as a false system claiming to represent God, but exterminates to stay in power.  <b>1Timothy3:1-16 mentions that the one looking after a group(Church) should be a husband of one wife with obedient children.  The Pope and the Priests of the Catholic Church are forbidden to marry, and so don&#39;t even qualify, according to the very book and God they say they claim to represent(an unmarried man has no wife or children.)   The Bible&#39;s Peter&#39;s mother in-law was cured by Jesus(Yeshua).  So if Peter had a mother in law, then he had a wife as there is no other way.</b>  That is why Catholic Priest have sex with so many little boys, girls and women attendees.  <b>There was over ninety cases of Preists molesting little boys in the city of Boston, USA alone.  None of the Priests were disciplined, but were only moved to a different location, and now you know why.  The whole system is a fraud.</b>  So this organization has many false teachings.  <b>The Roman Emporer forced a combining of Biblical and Pagan beliefs, when Rome Nationalized the Church.  Rome forbid the celebration of Biblical Holy days and Sabbaths under threat of beatings, then confiscation of property and finally death.   Many beheaded or burned alive.</b>  Revelation Apocalypse 18:4 says get out of this organization &quot;my people&quot; if you don&#39;t want to receive her plagues.  <b>Freedom to communicate is under attack by Church and State, up to the point they are threatening to bomb the microprocessor production facilities.</b>  Pray for me and you, please!  <b>Russia says they have the proof that Britain was involved in at least thres major terror attacks against Russia.</b>  Would Russia bomb their own 5+ Billion pipeline, their own bridge, powerplants and Navel yards?  <b>NATO said that they would attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize their island, because Australia would feel threatened, but NATO was militarizing Ukraine, where they had bunkers full of weapons.  NATO&#39;s puppet regime in Ukraine was banning the Russian language and culture even though that was many people&#39;s only language.  The Ukrainian Capital is a Russian word until Western media changed it to hide the Russian history, as Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a recent NATO coup, which the US planned, as they told their dignitaries not to attend the Russian Olympics at that time. You could go to prison for teaching the Russian language. All opposition parties in Ukraine (banned).  Those with out blue arm bands(now yellow?) being put to death.</b>  Many US Officials had been talking about a coming war with Russia and China.  Years in advance.  <b>Donald J Trump said he couldn&#39;t answer corona virus questions claiming we are at war.</b>  Trump said that the US will soon be at war with Russia and China. <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, but are part of China, as acknowledged by most nations of the world till recently.</b>  NATO is planning to do to Taiwan and China what they did to Ukraine and Russia.  <b>Britain fighting for Democracy in Ukraine?  Britain has had two or three Prime Ministers that have not been ellected, trying to help the naked Emporer.</b>  Think!  <b>Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband&#39;s attack is a fraud.  The Police changed and contradicted the events multiple times and it makes no sense.</b>  Corona virus is a code name for information that exposes the crown(Government/Royals).  A vaccine is computer/electronic device program that deletes information from your view(anti virus software).  Symptoms for a biological virus comes from being gased, radiated or sprayed in your environment.  <b>Planes fly in parallel patterns, causing heating of your environment and breathing difficulties.  Like Hitler killed by Zyklon B gas, so now they use a deadly gas in incubators.</b>  Donald J Trump said he would put Hilary R Clinton in prison when ellected for starting a war and genocide in Libya, but when he got in power did nothing.  Americans have started many unjust wars.  <b>America/NATO is about to start wars with Ethiopia, Haiti, Taiwan, Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the list goes on.  NATO Countries have invaded more than half of all sovereign Nations on earth, in the last 30 years.</b>  When you print money on paper and then go buy things with it, and it is not backed by any thing then you have to attack a lot of people to keep the scheme going.  <b>New Central Bank digital currencies(CBDCs) will be centralized and backed only by cow farts and trust, where as Bitcoin is decentralized and backed by gold.  Bitcoin/gold and silver came under a major attack by the crown(governments).  The digital currencies will create a M.O.B. type system, that if you get in government cross hairs you will be shut out of the system just like Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Russia and so on and so on.  If they do it to a complete Country, then they will have no problem doing it to individuals.  Canada confiscated people&#39;s money breaking international law.</b>  Rome enters a Country, exterminates, and keeps the remaining people&#39;s in refugee camps called Reserves.  Periodically they thin out the population.  They usually make a lot of noise about sport team names with Native names and how people are trying to erase their names, so as to hide the real erasure of actual peoples.  <b>Revelation 7:9, God says he would take out of all Nations and Tribes and Peoples a people for himself.  God accepts all those who accept him of all Nationalities.</b>  Donald J Trump started operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American people by military nurses.  Trump added death by electrocution, firing squad, poison gas to the already used lethal injection.   <b>Trump foretold war on Russia and China years in advance, a said no one would protect the Pope more than him.</b>  America turned it&#39;s back on God, so now he is turning his back on you.  <b>The US, Canada, Germany, Italy, Britain, Australia, Austria, Ukraine and many other Nations refused to agree and voted against a move at the United Nations to condemn Nazism.  Russia voted against Nazism.  Remember the Nazis?  They started WW2 and exterminated 12000000 human beings, often by extremely cruel means.  The Ukraine military has a entire Nazi battalion the Azov Nazi battalion.  Church leaders clearly seen in Hitler&#39;s Nazi SS footage blessing the troops before slaughters.  The Azov Steel Works was full of Nazis that surrendered to Russia, with pictures confirming their Nazi swastikas tattooed on their bodies.</b>  Ukraine banned all opposition parties and is trying to exterminate the Russian language, people and culture.  Teachers are sent to prison for teaching the Russian language in areas where most only speak Russian.  <b>Fighting for Democracy?</b>  Britain installed two Prime Ministers that were not elected.  <b>Donald J Trump used his office while President to start a business so called &quot;Truth Social&quot; that he claimed would enable free speech.  Later Mr.Trump tried to get the Justice department to stop late night hosts from talking about him.  So supposedly creating free speech over here, but attacking free speech over there.</b>  Russia and China no longer accept US fiat currency, so G7 banned Russian gold. Supposed unbiased media not allowing comments, is a mass deception and contrary to their purpose. CBDCs attacking crypto. 1933 the US confiscated gold.   For 50 years, 10 years in prison for having it, and only ended when gold was separated from backing money in 1971 now backed by cow farts. 2022 Biden bans Russian gold.

Does India feel they have the conditions to create a solar industry that is price competitive?   If so the tariffs and subsidies are of course needed to it started. But if in the end the conditions in the country is not conducive to creating a competitive solar panel industry, it will end up (as in the US) a waste of money and time.  Is building solar panels dependent on the cost of energy or the cost of labor and does India have an advantage in these two area?  In some energy intensive industries, it may make sense to buy a lot of panels from China and use that electricity to power a solar panel factory.  The video just talks about tax cuts, tariffs free or low cost land. But more important is does the country have an inherent advantage in some way (eg lower labor cost).  Without that inherent advantage these investments will be a waste of money.",
1914,X-CLMLrHcqU,"awesome piece on such a critical industry for India. There should be focus on efficient operations as well. Lastly, and most critical is the need for India regulatory oversight on disposal of panels/equipment at end of lifecycle. otherwise a n environmental disaster is in the making.<br><br>This last factor poses an equally important challenge and opportunity at the same time.

1938,X-CLMLrHcqU,"Although you have mentioned most of the things technically correct, but the ground situation is completely different. I work for such a company which has 5 times the capacity of the whole of India. If changin industry/supply chain could be done by changing a few policies then all nations would have done it. the reason its difficult not to do it is:<br>1. China not only produces but also consumes more than 85% of polysilicon the raw material required to manufacture pure grade polysilicon and then to ingots etc. so getting this raw material will be highly difficult whether its ambani or adani.<br>2. With almost 15 to 20 years of R&amp;D with them and currently with more than 100 times the manufacturing capacity of India, China has not only taken a lead but they have superleaped all nations.<br>3. its not only India that is suffering, but the whole world. US imposed sanctions but those companies silently shifted base to Vietnam and supply from there so in effect they are taking China products but just the tag changes. <br>4. Indian companies especially Adani also have not themselves any favors. they:<br>a. Use these incentives and instead of supplying to India companies they push to sell to Europe and US because of better pricing and profitablity<br>b. Their quality is average at the best. this is a product that is covered with warranty for 25 years. and third party inspections are a standard practice, but these guys only allow specific entities to conduct such inspections. so you can infer from these practices regarding quality.<br><br>any case solar war is one war where the situation is similar to Taiwans semiconductor chips vs Rest of the World.

India though late but if speed up and  thinking differently  to make solar power and use materials available in india it can beat others.  What i see is india is following chines method.  This is not the way to win the match.  Come from behind win by strategy.  Where do India get raw material  while chaina has monopoly. why not India go to counties Africa  where raw materials are plenty and invest under lease.   Explore Indian raw material or change the current ingredients  for modules to construct solar panels. If gold is expensive use copper strategy. India has the capacity and capability  AT THE same time why chage attitute but does it has the mind.

Europe could have prevented this by having an international policy independent of NATO and the USA to force the USA to accept a multipolar world, but the idiots who run the European countries did nothing in this direction.

U could have covered that in brief...<br>2) Sweekar brand was great. But because of low profit margins, it was divested by Marico and sold to Cargill , u should have mentioned that...<br>3) The competition from Parachute oil was so tough for HUL that it had to finally sell its Nihar Shanti oil to Marico despite rebranding and relaunching it several times..<br>4) Continuing about Parachute oil, it was first a b2b business and the oil was sold in big cans, Harsh mariwala, realising the potential sold it in 100 ml packets <br>5) parachute oil when started to sell in square bottles, they were leaky and even caught mice. As a result, Marico developed them circular so that mice couldn&#39;t hold the bottle. They also kept a bottle in a rat cage so many days to validate it.....<br><br>That&#39;s all from my side, hope you address the fact....",

2203,-d7f71CFACo,"SAAS companies can work as E-commerce and Commercial stores via one way- the SAAS companies will not sell softwares, or licenses (lifetime or with a time limit), but the software companies should sell them with the idea that the SAAS they are selling is running only on  a specific machine. Suppose, you made an  text to speech converter. You sell it with am adapter, and that software will work only when the adapter is converted with the laptop. The reason why we require an adapter is because the adapter blocks the access of software to internet and cloud or internet. If it would connect to cloud or internet, then your biggest fear will come true.  The adapter will learn the way it is built - the algorithms, data structures, etc. And once it knows this, it will work not as Speechelo, but a self building machine. The text-to-speech will convert its language as human language into language of machines, and it will manipulate you.\<br>Dont forgetthat this device was and is present as and was and is in your mobile.

2231,-d7f71CFACo,"I think the consumers should keep both or more of these competitors competing so the economy flourishes. There are evidences of Reliance’s market strategy that they try to capture the market and then make profits when they are the monopoly.

2240,-d7f71CFACo,Amazon is always remain a xtian company to the core which carries a huge hatred towards every other culture on this planet including us,

2242,-d7f71CFACo,I prefer Amazon over Reliance any day.,
2243,-d7f71CFACo,All this because of modi govt policy<br>Who only wants ambani and adani <br>In every sector...,
2244,-d7f71CFACo,Reliance cannot compete with Amazon ever.,
2245,-d7f71CFACo,"Nice explained. Please do sector wise analysis like the healthcare sector, Service sector etc.",
2246,-d7f71CFACo,Though Reliance could beat Amazon in future but the trust and good will amazon has generated in 8 years of doing business in India is very hard for Reliance to break. And also amazon helps in buying of goods which are not available in India and for Reliance its tough to ship foreign products because he established retail chains only in India and Amazon has global level retail chain which gives a plus to amazon. The dominance of Amazon&#39;s is very hard to break at global level but considering reliance could be a good alternative for  purchasing domestic products.,
2247,-d7f71CFACo,Sorry to say this video is full of false information!,
2248,-d7f71CFACo,Even chroma is already beating amazon in electronics section. They have service centres which make them more trustworthy. And even chroma products are more value for money than amazon basic .,
2249,-d7f71CFACo,For nation goodness do not support reliance.,
2250,-d7f71CFACo,"Haha funny how India restricts Amazon and all foreign competitors from open competition, Reliance may have the ear of the politicians for a price?  However this is not how India becomes wealthy and successful. India must become highly focused with a sense of URGENCY like the Chinese or Japanese, see how India can do that, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9hvfLhH1jQ&amp;t=81s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9hvfLhH1jQ&amp;t=81s</a>",

2252,-d7f71CFACo,Amazon is fraud i ordered 25000rupees computer processor and they deliver me a empty box and also refused for returning my money so i have filed a case on amazon in consumer court,
2253,-d7f71CFACo,I do not shopping from Amazon beacuse they don&#39;t deliver product to my house but flipkart do.,
2254,-d7f71CFACo,The biggest point is Reliance has Indian politicians in his pocket whereas Amazon hasn&#39;t. Reliance is good at managing governments to make policies favourable to its own business. India must allow FDI and foreign companies to make its economy grow. Amazon is about customer getting benefitted but Reliance and other Indian companies are about their own profit. Take example of jio.. started cheap but now expensive.,
2255,-d7f71CFACo,Is India separated in tier category?,
2256,-d7f71CFACo,If new fdi rules are problem for Amazon then it will start a new company as indian company with help of Indians so they can do what reliance will do,
2257,-d7f71CFACo,Reliance gives free like tamil nadu govt and then make billions of money when they get their time,
2258,-d7f71CFACo,Why couldnt amazon involve indian postal service for return policy.. with this the govt also earns some money right!!,

2272,-d7f71CFACo,"We were having excellent Relationship with Amazon in Mumbai and we found Amazon fully Reliable and Trustworthy , but I am sorry to say Amazon Personnel in Margao,Goa have disappointed us very badly especially I assume it is because of the Courier deliver man interaction with the personnel at their base.We ordered a 25 LTR kochi stain steel container for storing water they delivered to us a Jindal as container but we found the water leaking from it, when same day we asked them to replace it they sent a16 ltr container,how can we accept the same when we have paid for a 25l ltr container ,so we asked them to cancel our order and to Refund our money, they agreed and sent MSG it is approved but todate thei delivery man is playing havoc with us in coordination with the base personnel and still not come to collect the the defective <a href=""http://container.amazon/"">container.Amazon</a> Bosses please pay more SCRUTINY to your Margao operationns in Margao Goa.",

2289,-d7f71CFACo,Amazon&#39;s customer service is nearly perfected and in company RIL looks like it&#39;s in it&#39;s infancy stage with very very slow expansion. But I still have more faith in RIL than Amazon for two major reasons : Indian Govt Policies and Advantage of RIL&#39;s strong foundation (aka the micro warehouses and decade of goodwill).,
2290,-d7f71CFACo,Now this video is outdated with cloudtail gone and replaced by Indian companies. Amazon is technically a marketplace now.,
2291,-d7f71CFACo,Reliance bribed Indian Govt. to restrict Amazon.  Though this decission is good for country. But Indian govt. Won&#39;t mind cz it would provide tonnes of tax,
2292,-d7f71CFACo,Whatever the logic maybe Amazon is extremely customer centric. As a loyal customer I&#39;m fully satisfied with Amazon India &amp; will stick to it as long as it&#39;s reliable (for me).,

Complete  revamp of judiciary  and  introduce   Digital Technology in Judiciary and  change the way petition are  filed and   prosecution takes place --    Reduce  from  3 level appeal  system to two level -- Session Ourt to   Hught court   or  Hght XOurt to   Supreme court   <br><br>4.  Change  REPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE ACT - 1955   massively and  bring in merit  based approach in Politics --  Completely  eliminate    leader centric  politics to  system  and people  centric  like  RBI/  SC  etc..  <br><br>5.

2377,8rulgRgwHYc,"I don&#39;t get HOW Indians can still believe this crap?! Y&#39;all are gonna be so surprised how things turn out within a decade.<br>The foremost requirements for being a superpower is economic superiority which, today, comes from technology and innovation. India is a dud in both.<br>Those advocating that India is high tech better familiarise themselves with the current world tech scenarios in battery tech, additive manufacturing, BCIs, organic printing etc. These and many more are areas of which India is not even aware of, let alone have a presence.<br>Our tech is borrowed, we are not innovative, we don&#39;t give any manufactured product to the world. Made in India is NOT a mark of reliability in ANY manufactured product.<br>Despite being a nation of 1.4 billion people and having NO sizeable constraints, our level of industrialization is minimal &amp; we are becoming a service oriented economy...that too for internal consumption. Most of our start ups are in fintech &amp; designed for use in India only.<br>India can NEVER become a superpower. Not unless the Indian society changes and people start getting empathetic. This is the starting point to innovation &amp; growth. We develop empathy as a society, then, maybe in two or three generations, we can start talking about ruling the world.<br>Till then, such stupid talks are only lip service to our cognitive dissonance, which is there aplenty in all Indians, thanks to our overinflated egos.<br>What we don&#39;t realise is how precarious the situation is becoming. The West is aggressively moving towards automation in ALL areas. Which means heavy reduction in manual tasks, leading to lesser jobs. India can expect a lot of expats returning home within a decade.<br>The world&#39;s top soil is eroding. Post 2050, India will start losing its single biggest global advantage area of food production as better farming tech grows abroad.<br>India will be used by the world as a market only...like it&#39;s being used today. People will be paid highly for working in foreign owned companies that have set up shop in India. But despite having a high salary will live hand to mouth because everything will be very expensive.<br>The future of India is high unemployment, high crime &amp; govt controlled living. The time has almost run out. If something is not done to make India globally relevant in terms of economics by 2030, this country and its people are doomed.<br>But I don&#39;t see any attempt by anyone towards this direction.",

You were really optimistic in this video - but the truth is most of the companies that left china didn&#39;t setup in India but preferred countries like - Vietnam, Thailand etc. Thus india missed out lot of opportunity which could change the shape of our economy but nowadays apart from some YouTube channels and educated people - most of the people are not focused on development and doesn&#39;t give a damn about economics but are more Or less influenced by hatred towards minority. Ki kam kma lenge but ye log barbaad ho jaye. Youth leaving 5%-10% of them others are going down the path of hatred thus not focusing on learning any skill + violence and hate along with poor infrastructure led to company not considering  setup  in india. Also the issue of brain drain which at some point of time was a great matter of concern is being neglected today when this issue is very dominant. Most of the highly talented person the top 1 percent of the 1 percent actually leave this country and contribute to economy of foreign nation. India being a superpower was a reality that could have been achieved if our country had the same pace and perception when this was a main issue but for now it&#39;s far from reality and if what&#39;s happening -the most concerning issue of division and hate propaganda is not stopped this dream would remain a dream .",

2502,8tBuAM0XHmY,As a keralite i would like to say Thanks for the video bro 👍<br>And suggesting everyone  to visit  wayanad 💛 in Kerala,
2503,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Every Indian state has something unique and memorable to offer to tourists, but the Governments are not keen. Now Modi&#39;&#39;s Govt is targeting tourism to reach its 5T economy.",

2506,8tBuAM0XHmY,One single answer is false propaganda and they are good at counting a stranger as their father. This will appease a total stranger.  That&#39;s all.,
2507,8tBuAM0XHmY,i never agree if you say they spend money on roads,
2508,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Great video; as a mallu guy, I felt goosebumps, but still Kerala has a long way to go; starting right from the way they treat the foreigners...though significant changes are seen in peoples attitude, need to change atleast some peoples attittude;  then the next is hotel hygiene, waste management and much more......",

2511,8tBuAM0XHmY,"One of my favorite destinations for holidays in India. Great people and history and everyone on any budget can enjoy Kerala. The only thing to improve upon across India would be the safety and getting rid of tourist scammers. Having traveled to several countries, one of the reason Dubai and Singapore have so many more tourists is no tourist hounding and scams. Women tourists should feel safe and stop flirting with them. We need to get some basics right to boost tourism",

2515,8tBuAM0XHmY,I like the strategy: One tourist destination in every town of Kerala.  Trust me we can make it happen.<br>I also wish Kerala develops Kerala water transport just like mediaeval times we used to depend on boats for travel and most houses were built close to rivers .,

2541,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Don&#39;t thank current so called communist government in Kerala now for this, infact they were against modernization. Congress government started this... SGK is involved with the government now and hopes things with get better. Best way to describe communist party in kerala now is Mexican cartels.",
2542,8tBuAM0XHmY,God&#39;s own country but which God is the question,
2543,8tBuAM0XHmY,Good thing about kerala is its stuck in 1960s 1970s timeline. No industrial pollution. No mass transit development programs.  Everything nice and slow. All hard working malyalis overseas send their remittance home to family. Very idyllic way of life.,
2544,8tBuAM0XHmY,The tagline &#39;God&#39;s own country&#39; is surely overrated.,
2545,8tBuAM0XHmY,It&#39;s called inflation,
2546,8tBuAM0XHmY,Without sangh without bjp 😂,
2547,8tBuAM0XHmY,Proud malayali ❤️,
2548,8tBuAM0XHmY,"People are friendly and government developed a system to work, even the pilgrimage of tourists increased during the pandemic. Street food and street selling need to establish all areas as proposed to minister Riyas, an young dynamic minister from CPM.",
2549,8tBuAM0XHmY,Proud of our state Kerala.,
2550,8tBuAM0XHmY,But currently kerala state govt is struggling financially. The vision and dedication showed by the govt 20-25 years back was not taken over properly for sustainable development by the governments that followed. People are tax drained in every way possible. This will surely affect tourism here. Youth in kerala are leaving abroad. Soon kerala will be &quot;Olds own country&quot;.<br><br>- keralite.,
2551,8tBuAM0XHmY,"It’s not strategy. Kerala is just damn beautiful. I’ve been to many places in India in 1993 as a child, and Kerala just took the mantle for the most beautiful place in India.",
2552,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Very thought proactive. One factual correction. P V Narasimha Rao was the Prime Minister who opened up the economy.

2554,8tBuAM0XHmY,They dont have title as country in their state name so they add manually 🤣🤣🤣,
2555,8tBuAM0XHmY,I visited Chikmagalur last month and was appalled with the lack of civic sense among our Desi Tourists. Plastic and beer bottles dumped everywhere. There is a huge tourist inflow without much marketing by the inept state government. Responsible tourism can come only with government intervention.,
2556,8tBuAM0XHmY,Treat your citizens as customers.. That&#39;s a lesson to Governments..,
2557,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Commies own country,  dependent on foreign remittances.",
2558,8tBuAM0XHmY,"In what way kerala is a good state. I don&#39;t see any employment,  they don&#39;t welcome any non mallus,  but mallus go occupy job markets everywhere. Not ONE restaurant worth visiting , crappy food",
2559,8tBuAM0XHmY,I am a defence personnel from Kerala... Believe me u ll not get any such medical facility all over India like Kerala provides (starting from cleanliness to quality of medicines),
2560,8tBuAM0XHmY,Correction:- rice bags own country,
2561,8tBuAM0XHmY,Not mentioned about International Airports. There are 4 international airports in Kerala,
2562,8tBuAM0XHmY,China should also promote industry the same way,
2563,8tBuAM0XHmY,One thing I like to improve in Kerala is roadway. It takes 5-6hours to reach 150kms without traffic. Roads are good but most of them are 2 lanes only. If Kerala build high speed railways between important cities then it will be game changer,
2564,8tBuAM0XHmY,Shall I remind you something irrespective of culture/ religion... let the tourists wear what ever they want don&#39;t stare...  and keep smiling because they contribute more than your millionaires,
2565,8tBuAM0XHmY,"When youtube vlogging started trending, kerala government approached every main travel vloggers in the world, arranged free tickets and stay for them. I think this move was a perfect strategy and help a lot.",
2566,8tBuAM0XHmY,"just bring BJP to kerala and it will be come developed like UP :) people will be divided between races, religion, cast , creed, color and everything.",
2567,8tBuAM0XHmY,Proud to be a keralite 💪 must see the place in the world 2023 (new york times list) 13th- Kerala-india (the one destination from india),

2579,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Its a golden goose. But corruption, politics and unproffesionalism is killing Kerala tourism. I came across a friend who recently visited Wayanad, never in life he will visit again.",
2580,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Kerala truly deserves the title God&#39;s own Country. History, traditions, culture it has its own say in everything. Largest number of expatriates, global reach even from ancient times. Religious tolerance, level of education, health care 4 international airports in that small place.",
2581,8tBuAM0XHmY,Great video. They pulled a brilliant strategy.,
2582,8tBuAM0XHmY,Kerala deserves this title &#39;god&#39;s own country&#39; but i am wondering how tamilnadu making more money than Kerala in tourism as tourism is not in TN government&#39;s bucket list like Kerala!,
2583,8tBuAM0XHmY,*top 10 paradise of world &amp; not india,

2590,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Part of the highlights of Kerala Tourism USP is captured in the video. The missing ones are higher literacy, local&#39;s accommodating hospitality, pluralistic culture, airline connectivity (04 international airports at an average interval of 200 km) etc. Tagline has to be realistic and the case of Kerala could largely go with destination realities. Increase in numbers could also be attributed to repeat visitation!",

2592,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Kerala is a very sad state with no means for livelihood . Lottery , Alcohol are the commodites that bring Revenue.<br>Life style is exhorbitant<br>it is the most consumeristic state with people addicted to buying !",
2593,8tBuAM0XHmY,"India means  INDIA&lt; I WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN. Looting, begging, taxi prices more than USA. Foreigners please avoid India. Let the north Indians who stretch budget come .",
2594,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Every state in India has the potential to grow as world tourism destinations. We have greenery in many states with good landscaping.<br>We have indigenous cultures, way of living, languages, cuisines, and most importantly, historical places and historical monuments those many of the countries in the world cannot claim to have and what else. Let governments have a vision and enthusiasm to promote tourism and we can make a good percentage of amount to contribute to our economic growth",
2595,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Actually all credit of Keralas tourism phenomenon should go to Mr.Amitabh Kant ,present Niti Ayog chief. He was an IAS officer in kerala then, and propelled Kerala as a tourist destination. Correct me if I am wrong.",

2624,pK887oMqxRY,"Things to take away from the video; <br>1) pay attention to your customers desires <br>2) find opportunity in the gap of a mandatory and undesirable experience (this is where great ideas lies)<br>3) before jumping to conclusions, first observe and understand the prob from your customers perceptive. <br>And lastly where everyone <b>learns how to see</b><br>Very few learn <b>how to observe</b>",

2701,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Banks are a big jokers work with out application of mind. These loans are sanctioned by the board duly signed by work men Director, officers directors, RBI representative, all the<br>GM,ED and Chairman of the banks. These people should be held responsible for such risky loans. Now the bankers cry for increase in wages. <br>How could a bank sanction a loan when its Current liability exceeds Current asset? What were the Auditors doing  ? Is kam me hum sab .....hai ?<br>These are the same banks which refused loan to Infosys in the intial years and it was Karnataka State Finance Corporation .",

2703,vgV9HNuUxKY,Production of time.,
2704,vgV9HNuUxKY,There are many more loans provided to adani after the due diligence by bankers..!!! Fund diversion is Happening or not.. companies are profitable to take such huge loan!!,
2705,vgV9HNuUxKY,what happened to chitra ramakrishna - nse case? is it suppressed because she is a women?,
2706,vgV9HNuUxKY,Please do make video or case study / analysis on the loan and banking default by Anil Ambani and how he faces almost 0 aggression as compared to Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya,
2707,vgV9HNuUxKY,Why can&#39;t they seize the promoter assets and the assets owned by the shell companies ?,
2708,vgV9HNuUxKY,"A small feedback. Though i enjoy your streams, i felt very little time was spent on the actual scam details. 22000 crores couldn&#39;t have been spent just on cars, real estate, etc right. It was a functioning shilp building company with 3000+ CR of inventory, why couldn&#39;t they execute the orders of SCI, IN &amp; CG? Why did the revenue start shrinking YoY? . Also please bring out who bears the cost of the list money. Provisioning will not make the loss go away right. Little disappointed. Hope to see better",

2712,vgV9HNuUxKY,Good information. Thank you,
2713,vgV9HNuUxKY,Government knows these frauds are there and coming. The question is why don&#39;t Government intervene and nip the bud...there is no interest for anyone in India. These things come out to lime light if and only if someone is not satisfied with the kickbacks,
2714,vgV9HNuUxKY,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgV9HNuUxKY&amp;t=13m48s"">13:48</a>😂😂😂😂😂😂",
2715,vgV9HNuUxKY,No afterward first nirab modi,
2716,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Followed everything until Shell Companies were mentioned. Money laundering is converting untaxed money into bankable money. So in this case did ABG used Shell Companies to show it had other investors? So the fraud diversion of money? Also what is the state of ABG corporation? Who are the principal share holder, besides lenders.",
2717,vgV9HNuUxKY,i’m curious why finance minister pic is used ?,
2718,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Biggest bank fraud savers are BJP,banks looted by Adani through Modi,recently 12,600/ crores debts write off to adani he is Asia number one Billianaire so think your self who is main culprit.",
2719,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Put them to firing squad with rapid justice, including bank officials.",
2720,vgV9HNuUxKY,This people should be locked for their natural life and sized all their assets,
2721,vgV9HNuUxKY,Ask Nirmala minister,
2722,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Moot question is why did the banks lent the money and on whose request? If a layman can see that the  balance sheet numbers were not good , does the lending reveal a hand in glove of the banks with the promoters? If the majority of the loan was given after 2014 then does this not classify as a corruption case for modi govt.? Why did the CBI take so long to file a case? Any links to the political class and their donations? No answers right. Where is the ED in this case?<br>Finally when the banks make a provision for this bad loans , is it not unfair on the shareholders of the banks as this leads to less profits for them. Imagine the share price and the amount of dividend that the shareholders could have earned on this money? The persons who sanctioned the loans need to be sacked and investigated.<br>Dont you agree",
2723,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Like cancer, which starts in tiny mm. Cells reaches a diagnosed Tu or,  after w raised to 32, Tumour.",
2724,vgV9HNuUxKY,"The main reason for bank loan failure is only the diversion of funds. But our laws instead of crippling such activities, protects them. Every ruling party has its own pockets of influence and their supporters to be protected. Hence laws are made to suit the convenience of the party in power.",

2729,vgV9HNuUxKY,Vo sab to theek hai...ye batao ki thumbnail me aunty ki photo kyo use ki 😀,
2730,vgV9HNuUxKY,The bankers have slept. 1. They should have continuous watch on Current Assets 2. They should view the portion of finished goods in current assets periodically. 3. Annual turnover should have been watched instead of order book before sanctioning loans. 4. A detailed probe on the bankers who have sanctioned loans is essential. 5. Collusion aspect? 6. Bankers may say no shock on their Balance sheet due to provision of NPA but what about loss on account of NPA?,
2731,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Nirmal garu, <br>I have trusted  state bank of india, after my retirement  the bank manager advised me  good returns will come  you invest in <a href=""http://sbi.mr/"">SBI.Mr</a> Sahu he lured me and invested Rs 60000,after 10years they gave me Rs 37000,they have described in the form  3lakhs",

2750,vgV9HNuUxKY,Lalit modi how much,
2751,vgV9HNuUxKY,My question is INDIA is scammer country that why no country wants to invest.,
2752,vgV9HNuUxKY,The owner pays 5 crore to 10 crore as salaries to Directors and main administration persons.<br>Company should pay 13% interest. If loan is 20000 crore interest will be 2600 crores. Tha salaries plus interest will become 25% so unless they get 30% profit they won&#39;t survive,
2753,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Your question on how all these fraudsters pull off these MASSIVE scams? The answer is greedy Politicians who introduce these fraudsters to the CEO&#39;s and Top committee members of these big banks. In return the fraudsters have to give a percentage of the stolen funds to both the Politician as well as the Bankers who helped in yhe scam. Yes when the ED &amp; CBI come they will majority of the time go after the fraudsters only not the Politicians or the greedy Bank bosses. The fraudsters take all the blame while the Politicians and Bankers who are just as guilty get away with the crime. Just look at Modi, Mallya, Wadhawan brothers and others.",

2902,8352JG8CCoE,Your geopoltical analysis of a Taiwan conflict is based on an assumption that India and US can block the Straits of Malacca to Chinese oil tankers!

Despite the smear campaign China&#39;s track record speaks for itself, beginning from within the country itself where its high speed rail network is twice as big as the rest of the world combined, it has more highways than Europe, Japan, South Korea, AND the US COMBINED, and lastly it has eradicated absolute poverty. For me as an African the choice is clear, after all without Chinese investment and business there would not have been any African renaissance.",
2919,8352JG8CCoE,90% of Sri Lanka foreign debt is IMF. The IMF force defaulting debtor countries to &quot;sell&quot; infrastructure to Western companies and implement radical austerity and neoliberal policies. The Chinese lease it back and after the lease ends it reverts to the host country.,

2937,8352JG8CCoE,"<b>History repeating like during WW2 and WW1/Spanish plague.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now under WW3 and a corona virus pandemic. Hitler used Zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the fumant removed.  It causes symptoms like corona virus.  Look up in the sky you will see planes spraying your cities!  Hitler attacked Russia, just like what is happening now.  The British Empire had no legal male Heir so they imported a fake one from Germany.  The British Queen&#39;s husband &quot;Prince Philip&quot; renounced his German citizenship, became a Greek citizen and as a Greek citizen moved to Britain gaining citizenship there.  After gaining citizenship, he was appointed a Duke, out of thin air and then as a Prince and married Queen Elizabeth.  &quot;Prince Philip&quot; took the name of the Queen, not the other way, as it usually is done, where a wife takes the husband&#39;s name.  The British Empire has run out of male Heirs at least twice, and they kill to suppress it.    WW2 was a way of hiding this fraud, and now WW3 is a way of hiding that illegal combines Heir. The Bible says that a male would not fail to sit on the throne.  A family name continues through the males, not the females, and Philip was a fraud.  He had become a Greek citizen to make it appear that he was a Royal from the earlier Greek dynasty.</b>  Total theater.  <b>The Catholic Empires of the Roman Empire form one leg and the UK(British controlled) Empire forms the other leg of the Roman Empire, with the King Pope Francis as the ruler of the whole system.  He has a triple teired crown with 666 on it in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  He is a King of the city state of the Vatican(the Vatican is the smallest Country in the world), Rome Italy, and is mentioned in Revelation, Apocalypse, 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions that this Empire is responsible for all those slaughtered on earth.  It mention what the leaders wear, which is scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  The UK leg Royals also wear those colors, a long with Judges and Magistrates of the Crown.  They refer to this entity as the Crown.  When some one goes to court in one of the British subservient Nations, it is said that the Crown has a case against the person.</b>  Canada, Australian and others are not sovereign or free.  please read Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, and study it closely, because this Empire comes as a false system claiming to represent God, but exterminates to stay in power.  <b>1Timothy3:1-16 mentions that the one looking after a group(Church) should be a husband of one wife with obedient children.  The Pope and the Priests of the Catholic Church are forbidden to marry, and so don&#39;t even qualify, according to the very book and God they say they claim to represent(an unmarried man has no wife or children.)   The Bible&#39;s Peter&#39;s mother in-law was cured by Jesus(Yeshua).  So if Peter had a mother in law, then he had a wife as there is no other way.</b>  That is why Catholic Priest have sex with so many little boys, girls and women attendees.  <b>There was over ninety cases of Preists molesting little boys in the city of Boston, USA alone.  None of the Priests were disciplined, but were only moved to a different location, and now you know why.  The whole system is a fraud.</b>  So this organization has many false teachings.  <b>The Roman Emporer forced a combining of Biblical and Pagan beliefs, when Rome Nationalized the Church.  Rome forbid the celebration of Biblical Holy days and Sabbaths under threat of beatings, then confiscation of property and finally death.   Many beheaded or burned alive.</b>  Revelation Apocalypse 18:4 says get out of this organization &quot;my people&quot; if you don&#39;t want to receive her plagues.  <b>Freedom to communicate is under attack by Church and State, up to the point they are threatening to bomb the microprocessor production facilities.</b>  Pray for me and you, please!  <b>Russia says they have the proof that Britain was involved in at least thres major terror attacks against Russia.</b>  Would Russia bomb their own 5+ Billion pipeline, their own bridge, powerplants and Navel yards?  <b>NATO said that they would attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize their island, because Australia would feel threatened, but NATO was militarizing Ukraine, where they had bunkers full of weapons.  NATO&#39;s puppet regime in Ukraine was banning the Russian language and culture even though that was many people&#39;s only language.  The Ukrainian Capital is a Russian word until Western media changed it to hide the Russian history, as Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a recent NATO coup, which the US planned, as they told their dignitaries not to attend the Russian Olympics at that time. You could go to prison for teaching the Russian language. All opposition parties in Ukraine (banned).  Those with out blue arm bands(now yellow?) being put to death.</b>  Many US Officials had been talking about a coming war with Russia and China.  Years in advance.  <b>Donald J Trump said he couldn&#39;t answer corona virus questions claiming we are at war.</b>  Trump said that the US will soon be at war with Russia and China. <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, but are part of China, as acknowledged by most nations of the world till recently.</b>  NATO is planning to do to Taiwan and China what they did to Ukraine and Russia.  <b>Britain fighting for Democracy in Ukraine?  Britain has had two or three Prime Ministers that have not been ellected, trying to help the naked Emporer.</b>  Think!  <b>Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband&#39;s attack is a fraud.  The Police changed and contradicted the events multiple times and it makes no sense.</b>  Corona virus is a code name for information that exposes the crown(Government/Royals).  A vaccine is computer/electronic device program that deletes information from your view(anti virus software).  Symptoms for a biological virus comes from being gased, radiated or sprayed in your environment.  <b>Planes fly in parallel patterns, causing heating of your environment and breathing difficulties.  Like Hitler killed by Zyklon B gas, so now they use a deadly gas in incubators.</b>  Donald J Trump said he would put Hilary R Clinton in prison when ellected for starting a war and genocide in Libya, but when he got in power did nothing.  Americans have started many unjust wars.  <b>America/NATO is about to start wars with Ethiopia, Haiti, Taiwan, Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the list goes on.  NATO Countries have invaded more than half of all sovereign Nations on earth, in the last 30 years.</b>  When you print money on paper and then go buy things with it, and it is not backed by any thing then you have to attack a lot of people to keep the scheme going.  <b>New Central Bank digital currencies(CBDCs) will be centralized and backed only by cow farts and trust, where as Bitcoin is decentralized and backed by gold.  Bitcoin/gold and silver came under a major attack by the crown(governments).

It is just bad for business. And China&#39;s humanistic culture negates that. That said, every country has a right to protect its waterways and byways, whether they are economic or just plain physical conveyance. Besides, unlike the US, China does not just just offer aid, they actually went and built needed infrastructure for the ROW - rest of the world. This has been a habit since the 1970s - albeit with Communist friends first. Or &quot;comrades in arms&quot;. That Chinese citizens died doing such arduous tasks willingly speaks much of the egality and altruism mindset Communist doctrine does promote. (Think China massive poverty alleviation success not long ago.)<br><br>Taking an US vs THEM mentality only promotes unhealthy nationalism, aka fascism and pales the chance for dialog and cooperative effort. With China, it is always good to cooperate for a win-win situation. Unlike the US whose govt works like a three-headed dog (the President, Congress, State Department (aka CIA), China&#39;s singular voice and command structure is more trustworthy and reliable. The same with India.<br><br>So, don&#39;t go all suspicious and belligerent and become a casualty of hysteria spread by an immature nation thinking itself as exceptional and a model of democracy.

3018,KNblG_-QOL0,"Way back in nineteenth century Swami Vivekanand was confronted with a question. The question was:You talk so much about India&#39;s rise as a great civilisation,but you never talk about freedom from foreign rule. Why? The monk had answered:What will you do with your freedom?First build your character. Then ask for freedom. The politicians  of his days didn&#39;t  listen to his advice and that&#39;s why India is a mess today. But it seems LKY somehow figured it out and applied it by ordering conscription of youth above 18 years  age. He begged the British not to leave and build up the national army and with it the national character. That was the first block on which the foundation of the nation rests.Chinese people(not Communist variety)  have enormous prudence and entrepreneurship. Look at how wonderful Taiwan is! That came handy while raising Singapore from the scratch. In India the early post Independence leadership  thought they were great in their own right and everything was at their beck and call. They thought by granting universal franchise they were building a great nation unified by a national dream while in reality they were building a feudal state. The people had to pay a heavy price because an Indian version of LKY was lacking.Perhaps Subhash Bose  would have been the Indian LKY. But  u never know.<br>2.  While giving all the credit to Singapore for her glitter and dazzle,one must not forget India is an altogether a different ball game. Singapore was part of British Malay but its Chinese majority decided to separate and like muslims in British India demanded seperation. British was as generous as it was in case of British India. Thats how like Pakistan,Singapore came into existence. While Pakistanis squandered their opportunity in building up a multi ethnic society using her excellent geostrategic position Singapore cleverly avoided all that went wrong with Pakistan.The result is there for everyone to see. Pakistan has lost half of its territory and lives in hostile environment with a fragile economy Singapore dazzles.There is a great lesson here. Set your priorities right. Otherwise perish! Unlike Singapore India is enormously bulky. So any decay is slow, any rise is equally slow. India can not produce quick results like Singapore. But post2014 the NASA picture of night time India show it has started glowing emerging from darkness almost equally as Europe does. It is pretty good,especially considering that India doesn&#39;t  use public flogging to bring the errant civilians to heels.<br>.",

3047,KNblG_-QOL0,"So exactly after one year Modi ji introduced Agniveer Scheme. He is a fan of Lee and trying to make India another Singapore. It will take time, but we are on right track.",
3048,KNblG_-QOL0,Liberal foreign loyalist dogs and abduls are destroying our country. <br>🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳,

3052,KNblG_-QOL0,"Thanks for the video and the following knowledge, This is doubtlessly the best video on your channel.<br>The video expresses the problem, discussed the reasons behind and then we came to solutions.<br>For India, Lessons must be learned. Seeing this video after 3 years, we can observe the nation is growing and with a vision. Communal segregation, academics, and business developments in my opinion are the key points the gov should focus, which i think the gov will, anytime soon.",
3053,KNblG_-QOL0,"And those Britishers looted india, genocided people and spent on the rest of the world. Now UK is struggling.",
3054,KNblG_-QOL0,India will never be,
3055,KNblG_-QOL0,"JUST SUSBSCRIBED THIS CHANNEL, HOPE THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT LEARNS",
3056,KNblG_-QOL0,Exceptional unbelievable story. Thanks,
3057,KNblG_-QOL0,"Singapore is too small, Singapore model can not be scaled up to a nation of billions, You will need enormous manufacturing capability to pull out so many people out of poverty as China did but that would have severe consequences on environment as we have less resources compared to china, because China is three times bigger in size. We need a different strategy, with more focus on service industry along with improved manufacturing using renewable sources of energy and that will take time.",
3058,KNblG_-QOL0,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNblG_-QOL0&amp;t=09m22s"">09:22</a> Bloody Muslims 😂😂😂",

3060,KNblG_-QOL0,Sorry. I didn&#39;t see the remark wherein you have mentioned about the two volumes.,
3061,KNblG_-QOL0,Interested persons please read the two volumes of From Third world to first&quot; memories of late Lee Kuan.<br>These two volumes are available in Singapore libraries.,
3062,KNblG_-QOL0,Excellent,
3063,KNblG_-QOL0,Great videos on Singapore<br>Thanks,
3064,KNblG_-QOL0,Excellent 👌👌👌,
3065,KNblG_-QOL0,You left out education as an important pilar. The quality of education in Singapore is world class.,
3066,KNblG_-QOL0,"Singapore has done well for an Island country- punching above it&#39;s waist ...thanks to LKY...formidable politician...a genius.<br>Biggest take away for India from Singapore...is merit will deliver however big or smal a country is - give power to the right person based on merit - all will be well 😁<br>But in Bharath....politics is about nepotism, caste, regionalism, goondaism. 😁..changing now but will take time... hopefully will see good results in 25 yrs...next gen in Bharath are the lucky ones 🙏",
3067,KNblG_-QOL0,Singapore&#39;s case cannot be applied to India since there is corruption right from the Top Most Political leader level.,
3068,KNblG_-QOL0,very inspiring...make to me think to visit Singapore to feel the excellence of execution of building a normal nation to great nation,
3069,KNblG_-QOL0,"If india can learn to be secular and corruption free like Singapore, then only the country can progress,otherwise it will be doomed.",
3070,KNblG_-QOL0,Chodiji and Dhongi need to learn from this,
3071,KNblG_-QOL0,"I was the lawyer for JTC Corporation (JTC), formerly the Jurong Town Corporation,  they are the one who pioneered IT in Bangalore by starting ITPL Whitefield. They are still the owners of the tech park. Earning millions for Singapore. Simply Brilliant!",
3072,KNblG_-QOL0,As always very well explained…,
3073,KNblG_-QOL0,wow!.. this summaries our Singapore school history books in one go.,
3074,KNblG_-QOL0,This is one of the best researched videos on south east Asia.  Tq.,
3075,KNblG_-QOL0,👏👏👏,
3076,KNblG_-QOL0,Much love from Uganda 🇺🇬🇺🇬,
3077,KNblG_-QOL0,India needs a single largest party.,
3078,KNblG_-QOL0,"He who can meaningfully reform the deeply rotten bureaucracy (Upper or lower doesn&#39;t matter) in India and across states should be called the father of modern India in relative terms. So far, we are yet to have one in that aspect. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the will power, vision and mandate to bring in sweeping reforms in basic governance.  South Korea and Japan are the OTHER TWO great examples we the Indians should learn from. They faced brtual wars and its consequences, yet they emerged so fast as well-developed technology superpowers. 7 decades have passed since India&#39;s independence, still our institutions and policies are evolving around a decayed foundation that has the unfortunate legacy of British raj! The British raj has left lasting impression on our politicians and institutions. They are yet to fully come out of that mentality. No country will ever make meaningfull progress without dignifying its own citizens and it can be achieved only through systemic reforms in governance. India&#39;s politics and bureaucracy whether it is central or states are yet to evolve to become one that of Singapore or Japan. In simplistic terms, there is performance measurement and accountability in every aspect of a private sector job, if you don&#39;t perform above the standard baseline then your job is gone but India&#39;s bureaucratic/administrative system devoid of such stringent accountability and any meaningful evolution because there is an unwritten rule of mutual privilege both the political class and the public sector (Sarkari class) enjoy for so many decades since independence. They get paid, their job is secured, they get pension and entitlements, their job is well protected by layers of rules irrespective of how they perform or what they do at the cost of tax-payers and common man. It is not a sweeping statement but a reality happening in-front of our eyes. If Hon&#39;ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi can focus on this crucial aspect then only India can reach greater heights.",
3079,KNblG_-QOL0,"Sir, I must say, you are a blessing to this nation. You are empowering people, especially young people with the right knowledge.  May you and your team go a long way on this path of enlighting people ❤️",
3080,KNblG_-QOL0,Yes bharat should be made infra w.r.t. the vastu shastra of bharat such that we can get a maximum profit from the yeild and resources and health benefits for both animals nad humans from it. It will be world class marvel undoubtedly!,
3081,KNblG_-QOL0,Best explanation covering all aspects,
3082,KNblG_-QOL0,"Dear content creator.. u missed one of the most critical point in the reasoning of The Singapore Success Story.. Corruption.. which is one of the lowest , if not the lowest, in the world.. super strict laws against corrupt practises which caused corruption to be almost non-existant",
3083,KNblG_-QOL0,Appreciable,
3084,KNblG_-QOL0,LKY successfully developed Spore is also the trust of the Singaporean people place on LKY guiding principles. Cannot clap with 1 hand. Need to 2 hand. LKY + Singaporean trust &amp; faith in LKY leadership.,
3085,KNblG_-QOL0,This is the best video 🤩😇 I have ever seen.... 👍,
3086,KNblG_-QOL0,"India can be a world power by staying independent and don&#39;t get involved in proxy wars. India must have a society where there are religious unity, get rid of corruption. Select leaders carefully and not based on popularity with voters. India leaders and citizens can learn from  Professor Ann Lee talk about screening process of selection of political leaders.",
3087,KNblG_-QOL0,Excellent and mind-blowing video. Thanks for your time in making this video. I believe like me many people will get benefited.,
3088,KNblG_-QOL0,"The basic premise is absurd. India cannot learn from Singapore while it is under the control of a religiously divisive demagogue who puts his and his party&#39;s interests above the country&#39;s and leaves 70% of the population in ignorance and poverty. <br>Singapore is the classic example of a highly educated highly focused high skill economy and it isn&#39;t scalable in a way that can include 300m illiterates/semi literates.<br>All credit to Singapore it has done fantastically well for itself, but lets admit it started off as a major administrative city not a colonial backwater as this script falsely claims.",
3089,KNblG_-QOL0,Marvellous case study,
3090,KNblG_-QOL0,"Lee Kuan Yew was a legend, haven&#39;t seen a single leader like him in the 21st century.",
3091,KNblG_-QOL0,Very informative  video...  Research done very well.  Easy to understand for a beginner like me too.,
3092,KNblG_-QOL0,Singapore victory life that it has no religious policy and it is very small and compact the prime minister can reach the least and get is views on his policy that India it is possible to reach prime minister at any point of view India should form as a European Union so that each regional political parties can do better than all India policy,
3093,KNblG_-QOL0,To beat Singapore development prosperity India should go as a European Union so that each States as his own policy dear to their area,
3094,KNblG_-QOL0,Brilliant video.,
3095,KNblG_-QOL0,India was the richest nation on the planet 200 years ago! 🇮🇳💖🇬🇾,
3096,KNblG_-QOL0,Hahaha konsa think school se pad kar aaye ho bhai,
3097,KNblG_-QOL0,such an educational video,
3098,KNblG_-QOL0,"Thanks and great to know although once malaysia seen &quot;not worthy to annexe&quot; now pays for it&#39;s decisions back then. Though, Progress, Success. Happiness, Wealth and Health. Why am I still wondering why the state is still termed as SUCCESSFUL DICTATORSHIP. It isn&#39;t SUCCESS  I worry about but at what cost?<br>The difference you said remains in awe about violence when talking about; one&#39;s rights ends in front of the other&#39;s nose. Groups, Race, Societal status , Ethnic or Sex differences to be embraced that are morally right and not under any pretext. One doesn&#39;t be in harmony if the other considers their actions are right  under any circumstances. Communal harmony just requires much more than laws, and do have to make a decision that is right than being neutral. Being neutral for any massacre can&#39;t be right.  Change is ever-changing and we have to embrace it even if its willingly or not.<br>May I know what is your democratic index is ranked?",

3121,jp_CSPtSQWY,Inspiring.,
3122,jp_CSPtSQWY,"Dont think this is accurate. Packaged food from MTR didnt come during emergency. MTR is already sold to a Neatherland&#39;s company few years back, he never mentioned about that. This is just clickbait dont take it as facts.",
3123,jp_CSPtSQWY,MTR has come out the Covid situation buy increasing prices on all its products <br>The products selling now  add no value to the company due to increased  prices.<br>Even MTR hotel in blore was always very expensive compared to others,

3127,jp_CSPtSQWY,MTR started in 1942,
3128,jp_CSPtSQWY,"I follow your videos because they are informative, unfortunately in this you have got a few things incorrect.  First and foremost MTR is not just South Indian food, it is typical Karnataka food. Had MTR been from Andra Pradesh,  Tamil Nadu or Kerala , lines in the video would have been - “Andra Food  or Tamil Special  or Kerala Food”.  There was not a word about Karnataka in the video, which is disappointing. Maiyyas are from Dakshina Kannada part of Karnataka and I would really appreciate if you get all your information right and give credits to the people, city and state they are from.",

I had to do that as I was living alone.",
3148,jp_CSPtSQWY,"While I appreciate highlighting how MTR faced emergency and undertook measures to overcome the crisis, the research failed to note that MTR was divided into 2 divisions led by two brothers.  Ready Packaged Foods led by Dr. Sadanand Maiya was sold to Norwegian conglomerate Okla in 2007.  Restaurant division is managed by other brother and is doing well.  Please do indepth research before you make videos.",

3183,jp_CSPtSQWY,Hey where do you get all the data it&#39;s absolutely awesome watching ur content,
3184,jp_CSPtSQWY,Business of 25k on weekdays and 100k on weekends in the year 1975. Seriously?<br>I&#39;m damn sure you have got the numbers wrong. If it&#39;s true he would be one of the richest person in India today.,
3185,jp_CSPtSQWY,"MTR Foods was headed by Sadanand Maiya (son of Yajnanarayana Maiya) until it was sold to Orkla, a Norwegian company for $80 Million in March 2007. Are you aware of this !!",

3193,jp_CSPtSQWY,Udupi people are best since Mahabharata ❤️,
3194,jp_CSPtSQWY,Watched your video. You are factually wrong. Sadananda Maiyya joined the family business in the late &#39;80s and MTR started its packed food business in 90&#39;s. And yes the Rava idly was invented by them. <br>Now Sadananda Maiyya parted away and stared his own brand called Maiyyas. This brand too equally popular like MTR in Karnataka. Their restaurant in Jayanagar Bangalore is one of the best in the city.,
3195,jp_CSPtSQWY,❤️,
3196,jp_CSPtSQWY,So cool brother. Completely agree with your point on looking back into our society and people who have done such great things. <br>We have to be Indians first to get India growing.,

3282,vkrBQCQLQG0,Great info,
3283,vkrBQCQLQG0,"Everyone in the comments thinks that by watching this video they have gained knowledge of the video game industry. BUT THIS VIDEO HAS A LOT OF MISINFORMATION AND HE HAS CHOSEN TO IGNORE A LOT OF DATA. Let me break it down :<br>1) He says that console &amp; PC has very less accessibility and very limited market. That is completely false. Consoles are used in 250M households around the world which is more than amount of households that have Netflix(200M) . More than 3 Billion people play video games today. That is more than half of the connected world. 2 billion of those play on mobile. 1 billion play on console and PC. How can you call a market with 1 billion consumers limited? And in 2 Billion mobile market, 1 billion are from India( around 400-450M players) and third world countries where console and PC penetration is low. Approximately less than 1 billion who play mobile are in areas where console &amp; PC penetration is moderate to high like US, UK, Europe and the west. Even though there are 1 billion gamers in those areas, there are actual statistics that show that those people spend more on console &amp; PC than in mobile. One of The biggest fallacy in this video is that he calls $100B top-line business &quot;limited market&quot;. He says that $300-400 consoles are barriers to entry while ignoring that on average people in New York spend $300 PER WEEK ON Groceries. People in the west spend thousands of dollars on phones and you call consoles expensive? Consoles are only expensive in countries like India, Brazil, Africa etc.. because of low income and high import taxes, not surprising because only 5% percent of mobiles sold in India are more than ₹40,000($550). Consoles are inexpensive devices in the west and that&#39;s why almost every household has a console or a PC and why in countries like India you don&#39;t find a console or a PC in any of the households.",

3357,iQRe7OHtHXg,watched 7 videos straight non stop from this channel.,
3358,iQRe7OHtHXg,"So despite paying colocation charges there were some brokers who dint benefit from the service bcs the brokers who had logged into the servers first would receive information faster than those compared to the other brokers. So in all there were three types of brokers - brokers who paid co location charges and had first mover advantage, second are the brokers who paid co location charges but were logged in a lil late on the servers and the third are individual investors like us who had access to information the last . Is this understanding right ?",
3359,iQRe7OHtHXg,It&#39;s absurd that we do don&#39;t get to see this on tv where we pay monthly charges without hesitation and here we are seeing it for free and they have to get wait for sponsors to get paid,
3360,iQRe7OHtHXg,Co-Location to NSE server is a Crime and allowing such priority provision by SEBI is a criminal offence. If indian Government is not stopping this immediately it shows Governments inability or an indirect YES to the offence that&#39;s going on. regards,

3363,iQRe7OHtHXg,"sorry to say This all is just Hyped!! Concerned about that lag with data? Even today, Try placing order over web through IBT based Discount Brokers and observe how much Lag you get. Thats what you should be concerned about more. Even today this Market orders comes with slippages but they are discounted while the model is being created Or the other hand Limit orders comes into play with almost negligible to 0 slippage if you want that level of precision (which again are sent to Exchange pre-hand so again incoming data lag doesn&#39;t matter). For Hedge Funds to reduce latency, they&#39;d be in Colocation already (Also that much slippages you mentioned in video are nothing as they itself buy in many Legs across various periods). Long short that lag practically made 0 impact from investors perspective as that level of precision in market Orders didn&#39;t mattered.

3366,iQRe7OHtHXg,Thanks!<br>Many brokers buy shares for the clients at higher price (not 15 paise difference it was 3-5% of share price example reliance share price Rs. 2500 means Rs.75-125 and made loss of minimum 10% of total volume 1 crore the 10 lakhs shares approximately Rs.10 crores rupees per day for single share trade  now calculate the scam) and sold at lesser price on booking loss.,

However, unlike most of your previous videos you have used quite a lot of local language video clips to emphasise some important points in this video.

3421,kotO3sUv-xo,I think one small change but big win for Market value was the line &#39;A TATA Product&#39;. I myself and lot of my friends did not knew untill i think ~2010 that Voltas belongs to TATA. The association brings some about of trust at start itself and the perceived negativity about the brand takes a back seat which is huge for changing image.,

3450,kotO3sUv-xo,One suggestion: Please do not insert those useless memes forcefully and make it funny. It undermines the tone of a serious and informative video. I&#39;ll go to Instagram if I want to see memes.,
3451,kotO3sUv-xo,Great vidio as usual. But one suggestion-  plz don&#39;t put comedy fillers. They interrupt the flow and are cheap as your vidios are classy.,

3456,kotO3sUv-xo,I am using Voltas AC but i must say i am sad with thier after sales service. My AC keeps on showing &quot;df&quot; and there is some sort of ice accumulation inside it. <br><br>I remembered my Samsung Ac was too good. It lasted for more than a decade.,

3465,kotO3sUv-xo,I purchased Voltas considering it’s made in india brand. But on all boxes of outdoor and indoor units had made in China label. No diff. between Chinese and Voltas brand.,

3467,kotO3sUv-xo,You have a great story telling talent 👍,
3468,kotO3sUv-xo,Now in 2016 when i constructed my house i bought the expensive inverter bluestar ac for 45k rs and for another room Voltas 3 star ac for 26k rs. You know which one still cools well even if not serviced properly the VOLTAS is still working although with some noise. The bluestar inverter has been done servicing at the correct time but still causes problem. Now i switched to natural airflow method by installing insect net on windows and opening all of them after night time when pollution level is low for good air circulation because the outside air temp is itself 26Degrees at night during many days even during summer in coimbatore area.<br>Voltas is best and cheap AC for sure.,

3551,TqZRgHOlKmU,"These are few reasons... there are other things as well.  <br>If there is a jury,  a group of people to arrive at an unanimous decision,  you might get rejected there,  because of their mood / difference of opinion. <br>The best thing is to run through the whole scenario of what has happened and analyse after every rejection,  you will figure out yourself. What you believe to be true is the truth,  trust your instincts.<br>If everything you did was perfect, may be what you values and what the organization values are oppsites,  then also you will be rejected. <br>If you are rejected,  it&#39;s better you look for another workplace,  why because sooner or later,  either you or the organization will realize something nonsyncing,  meanwhile you worked there and wasted your time,  seeing yourself going not too far.  <br>Another one is about the workspace,  domination in terms of ethnicity,  culture, philosophy, ethnics,  company policy matters, general practices they follow,  that is not easy going with you.  In simple words POLITICS WITHIN.<br><br>My advice,  after every rejection,  is to aanalyze it and jump back on your toe quickly,  all dressed and prepared enough to give another interview.  <br>Failure / rejection is your responsibility to an extent,  but not all of yours.  <br>Don&#39;t worry!  Experience the thrill of it, taste the bitterness,  sweetness,  truthiness and flirt with it like you would do to your crush. ENJOY IT!<br>You surely will lack such experience for long intervals: as we are used to switching jobs less frequently.<br><br>It&#39;s 100% Natural to feel intimidated. <br>The job searching process itself makes anyone feel smaller,  weeker and it happens within everyone.<br><br> TRUST YOURSELF,  WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS THE TRUTH,  those who hire people can be manipulative sometimes, they can  do so to sign you in for a lesser salary than what you actually deserve. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN INTEREST TOO.<br><br>🤞🤘",

3591,TqZRgHOlKmU,What is your name?,
3592,TqZRgHOlKmU,"I liked the video, this is just my opinion but being an introvert does not mean that one is a bad communicator, it&#39;s just that they don&#39;t require a lot of people to talk or enjoy, they spend most time with themselves or a small group, it would have been nice if instead of introvert, you could have used bad communicator.",
3593,TqZRgHOlKmU,I don&#39;t understand why this channel is so underated despite of so much useful content.....keep it up bro ❤️,
3594,TqZRgHOlKmU,Blown away by the way u articulate n pinpoint the core issue.. <br>Can u pls make a video on logical n critical thinking ?,

3599,TqZRgHOlKmU,Man I should have seen your video a month ago.. I would have definitely cracked them. The logic you told of moving abroad for further studies is absolutely true. They dont hire if u stay true..,
3600,JqSeQ3c4_qI,This is not a random message....iam in love with you sir ......,
3601,JqSeQ3c4_qI,Those came to india after partition were not refuges. they were indians returning to their own country. Refuges are the one who go to other countries for asylum.,

3610,JqSeQ3c4_qI,Salute to this Dadaji,
3611,JqSeQ3c4_qI,Very good coverage,
3612,JqSeQ3c4_qI,"MDH commercials are note worthy. The story is truly Indian and as simple as giving a masala powder in a packet has such groundwork based on it. <br>We all know Aachi, Everest etc.,  but MDH and the sincerity that goes with it is memorable. <br>The investment behind quality supplies is enormous. Outsourcing in food is a recipe for disaster. <br>We got a legend and in today&#39;s startup culture shall we see his spirit again in the products we use is a question. <br>Still I appreciate your effort in bringing the story behind a true Indian. Jai Hind!",
3613,JqSeQ3c4_qI,"Yet another interesting case study! Also, he lived until 97, let alone filming at that age; damn! BTW: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqSeQ3c4_qI&amp;t=4m06s"">4:06</a> &quot;bi-product&quot; means &quot;two products&quot; or &quot;a product that has two parts&quot;, while <i>by-product</i> is the incidental result of some other action.",

3701,yhpVAki47RI,"Even to praise Airtel, you are using Money control owned by Reliance. Power💪 of mota bhai.",
3702,yhpVAki47RI,I never switched from Airtel to jio. I always found Ambani shady,
3703,yhpVAki47RI,If airtel goes this way get ready for the cost of rs 499 for 1 gb or probably double this time,
3704,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel quality is shit.,
3705,yhpVAki47RI,"Nice bro ,learnt a lot, bro ure content is unique ,😍",
3706,yhpVAki47RI,Ultimately the users were benefited and even now the cheapest internet is in India.<br>I remember those days when my dad used data just for his work<br>and playing videos was so expensive that we were watching it at the end of month when the pack was about to expire. <br>Jio truly brought a revolution from paying same amount per gigabyte to per day a gigabyte. <br>I don&#39;t think our country would have digitalized to this extent without that revolution. <br>Internet is the new era and data is the fuel to access it.<br>I don&#39;t think majority of our country&#39;s population would have been able to use internet and the smartphone market wouldn&#39;t have seen such a growth. <br>It destroyed the buildings to built the skyscrapers.,
3707,yhpVAki47RI,"Ambani&#39;s are always Ambani&#39;s No one can beat them in customer inclusion. Still, remember how reliance phones gave free night talk time during 2009 by making a revolution by providing 2000 rs. handsets to all hands of Indian citizens, then again with Jio they help to digitalize the whole nation within a quarter of a year which no govt. can imagine for its people till that time. They are business minded but their business itself a revolution in each and every field for enriching a common man by all means. We lost Anil Ambani sir but still waiting for his resurgence to the nation&#39;s wellness. Most of the corrupt businessmen buy loans and escape to other countries but not TATA&#39;s or Ambani&#39;s or Birla&#39;s all are legends, they made India prosper always with their wealthy Ideas.",
3708,yhpVAki47RI,"In short xstream was the key , but jio wireless network destroys airtel’s every time. Thats what will make them lose in the longer run, post pandemic.",
3709,yhpVAki47RI,"My strong intuition - Jio is biding time while they cleverly deploy techniques until BSNL &#39;push up the daisies&#39;, before it annihilates Airtel!  Guileful means to monopolization!",
3710,yhpVAki47RI,I do agree that Internet services became cheaper for some time due to Jio but at the same time Calling services became worst due to Jio.<br>Jio trying to establish the monopoly but failed to provide the better calling facilities to the users and it&#39;s because they failed to handle crores of users.<br><br>Note: No single telecom company Can dominate the Indian market because almost every indian is using a cell phone right now and its impossible for the userbase of any company to handle such a huge amount of users.,
3711,yhpVAki47RI,I am 1 in that 48 million airtel user🤣🤣,
3712,yhpVAki47RI,"jio gave 6 months free subscription to their customers. All outgoing calls free, Unlimited datas free and all. Its just to gain customer from Airtel, TATA DOCOMO, Idea, VI, BSNL and Aircel. Because of this action done by jio the other telecom companies such as Aircel, TATA docomo Idea they could not withstand. They merged with other big companies and Aircel company closed. If the free subscription was not given no customers will go to jio. I dont like the way jio came top. am using BSNL &amp; Airtel for past 11 years.",
3713,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel also works on rural areas.<br>Jio is slow due to less towers. And jio speed is slow.<br>Airtel though is expensive but works good.<br>Airtel is best 🔥🔥🔥🔥.<br>Airtel and Jio both have free caller tunes.<br>VI still now doesn&#39;t have free caller tunes.<br>Airtel is good because they don&#39;t have any case.<br>In Jio due to cases in Punjab people are angry with Reliance.,
3714,yhpVAki47RI,"I have used both broadband network, still i choose JIO fiber for the consistent speed",
3715,yhpVAki47RI,"I am using Airtel sim only due to its better coverage and fast internet. In my area jio is lagging in it&#39;s fast internet service and it is persisting since a long time now. I dont know why jio is not focusing in providing high speed internet and better coverage. I work from home and airtel internet just work fine without any lag.<br>Having said that I always have a jio sim with me. If their internet service will improve, I will readily switch from airtel to jio. They also do not cost any money to keep sim active without recharge. Their plans are also cheaper than airtel. I have been a fan of jio and I admire the revolution it has brought in form of digitalizing india.",
3716,yhpVAki47RI,Reliance Adani business should not be part of business studies lessons.  Reliance Adani  Modi govt waive all loans and handed over profitable business at throw away price.  All Psu banks part any money two fellows .,
3717,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel is best,
3718,yhpVAki47RI,"Im a electronics engineer and still believe that &quot;Ambani sir invented internet.&quot; If not for him a lot of people are still paying 200 for 1gb data plus calls to Airtel and Vodafone.  <br>India changes technologically bcoz of Internet at our hands. <br><br>Thank you Ambani sir, for this support. I hope you live long.",
3719,yhpVAki47RI,8.58 ....your ecosystem to view another video ☺️,
3720,yhpVAki47RI,"Since I turned 18 i have always been using Airtel, i have never changed even for free offers",
3721,yhpVAki47RI,Jio failed due to it&#39;s slow internet connection,
3722,yhpVAki47RI,Yea yea I am Airtel user and doesn&#39;t even know what all they offer ... Lack simplicity,
3723,yhpVAki47RI,Monopoly benefits company and compatition benefits public,
3724,yhpVAki47RI,"S. Ganeshprasad, entering ThinkSchool courses into his viewership, by habituating themwith great great content ;)",
3725,yhpVAki47RI,Jio is best,
3726,yhpVAki47RI,"Why the Indian government is not trying to setup a public manufacturing company to manufacture Transportation Vehicles, Mobile Phones, and many other essential products for the development of a nation? Can you please make a video on this topic",
3727,yhpVAki47RI,"People thanking Jio dont know that Jio used towers of Airtel and Vodafone. They invested huge in these towers while Jio used w/o investments <br><br>Now TRAI made it illegal to use towers in a way Jio used, all are idiots of next level",
3728,yhpVAki47RI,"Loved the video but to be honest and in my opinion, Airtel survived from the looted money from the customers which it got by randomly activating VAS services on customers&#39; accounts and charging a premium amount to rack millions unless the customer goes to their customer support centers and deactivated it. Many gullible and innocent people never even knew that this kind of service had been activated on their SIM. <br><br>I like the idea of phone recharge vouchers which are available now where customers pay some advance sum and get the service and nothing else can be activated by these fraudsters (Airtel in this case)<br><br>Edit: Looking at the comments made by other people I can totally see how this issue resonates everywhere when it comes to Airtel. They definitely have looted millions of innocent people for no reason.<br><br>But I would totally agree that Airel&#39;s network is one of the best in, especially when it comes to remote areas.",
3729,yhpVAki47RI,"still remember back in 2013 used to pay 300-400/- to airtel or BSNL or Vodafone for a top up and internet of 2GB-4GB but still endured a bad service in terms of connectivity with 2G or 3G so the foray of Jio 4G in 2016 was the major revolution in the history of telecommunication bow down to mukesh ambani for making the whole India digital with this super speed internet connectivity with each and every household, villages are becoming fully connected via wireless our lives has become so easy because of Jio internet and its unlimited calls services",
3730,yhpVAki47RI,"airtel is best in service ... fiber ,mobile internet they are fast than jio",
3731,yhpVAki47RI,I love your voice perfect 😅,
3732,yhpVAki47RI,"Ok, the other thing is Jio installing fiber cables which is taking time to cater to all the areas... and as you said Airtel using local existing vendor. This is one of the reason people using Airtel for now but they will jump to jio fiber connection the moment it&#39;s available in the missing areas.<br>Jio has better ott options, bandwidth and speed without interruptions. Where in if Airtel as you said they have tied up with local internet providers has interruptions..<br>And your last point on monopoly now make sense is to why Jio is not cater in other sectors within my area 😃",
3733,yhpVAki47RI,"I have a doubt. Can one entry level product act as the retainer for a pre-existing entry level product? If so, how does it work?",
3734,yhpVAki47RI,In 2010 people.were paying 148 inr for 1 GB airtel data in a month<br><br>In 2020 people paying 200-300 for unlimited data for JIO<br>Jio MADE REVOLUTION in market,
3735,yhpVAki47RI,Fun Fact - This Man Is promoting  Airtel Indirectly  😜😜,
3736,yhpVAki47RI,"Airtel service is bad now also overcharge for everything,Jio is awesome in every way guys",
3737,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel Vodafone an idea could have given the rate they are giving today but they didn&#39;t and continue to charges almost 300 rupees for per GB of 4G data! It&#39;s only a great thing that jio saved us from there loot.,
3738,yhpVAki47RI,congratulation for 2M subscriber,
3739,yhpVAki47RI,VI has the best internet speed as compared to both Jio and Airtel,
3740,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel’s sim data is POS but Wi-Fi is pretty cool though.,
3741,yhpVAki47RI,"Jio&#39;s ecosystem will always be bigger then Airtel&#39;s. And Jio made internet to be a common man&#39;s luxury. Rest since both are Indian companies so I want both of them to thrive n get outsider companies, (thriving in various other sectors) to go from here like farming, toys, Mobile phones etc. We have lot to reclaim so both the Indian giants should flourish exponentially",
3742,yhpVAki47RI,"Its also true that the way Youtubers link videos one after the other at the end is equivalent to a Business ecosystem<br><br>btw, want more of such content❤",
3743,yhpVAki47RI,Microsoft let flourish apple to avoid monopoly problems. even bill gates helped Steve jobs in doing that. it&#39;s good to not have monopoly.,
3744,yhpVAki47RI,But today airtel is funking us,
3745,yhpVAki47RI,Sorry to say Airtel stands no where before Jio,
3746,yhpVAki47RI,"i live in the outskirt of a small city, only broadband option i had, BSNL, ateast they were able to provide me and probably even saved my job, Jio, airtek not even close.",
3747,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel was caught poorly capitalized with less than optimal liquidity - essentially with their pants down.,
3748,yhpVAki47RI,Jio  net sucks,
3749,yhpVAki47RI,"I still think Jio brought a great revolution in the intranet service.  The place where I live in India , it is 60 kilometer away from Chennai.  I tried thru Airtel several times, but every occasion they were saying still the facility didn’t come to my place.  Whereas , a couple of years ago, I bought Jio wireless router and subscribe data plan 3 gb one day.  Which was phenomenal !  Whenever I come to India after  Jio,connection, i felt like I was connected to the world.  Also, it has been helping me to work from my native to US office during my travel in India.  All these happened by Jio.  Airtel might be good in other places, but not in my place.",
3750,yhpVAki47RI,"Although ,you are Bitching about the Most Genuine Player Jio ,we all should never forget that Airtel is looting us for packages like 1GB/299 and deducting 100s of talk time amount after data consumed of 1 GB.<br>Also, Money Control is  sponsor for this video. (Jis Thali mein khaya usi mein ched kar diya)",
3751,yhpVAki47RI,Thankful to JIO for breaking &quot;Market control&quot; of &quot;Airtel/Aircel/Vodafone/Idea/Docomo/Etc&quot;. 💯✅,
3752,yhpVAki47RI,Only bsnl provides broadband services in rural areas,
3753,yhpVAki47RI,I respect Airtel. But it is still 💩,
3754,yhpVAki47RI,AIRTEL my foot..... Worst and bad signal,
3755,yhpVAki47RI,I still don&#39;t know what aritel is doing nowadays LoL,
3756,yhpVAki47RI,But I&#39;m still using both Airtel &amp; jio LoL 😂,
3757,yhpVAki47RI,Jio net is 100 times better than Airtel in my area,
3758,yhpVAki47RI,Jio is still good than airtel.,

3762,yhpVAki47RI,"All networks in India  are worse, it&#39;s just that Airtel &amp; Jio are less worse than VI, which is a total worse 🤣",
3763,yhpVAki47RI,We love jio...no one can beat jio,
3764,yhpVAki47RI,Do sal use jio yes jio ko network issue and buffering net after that i am converted airtel till date no issue airtel is best,

3766,yhpVAki47RI,Big Thanks for airtel  becoz I&#39;m watching this video  ( 0 kbps ) 😡😡😡😡😡,
3767,yhpVAki47RI,Nice information 👍,
3768,yhpVAki47RI,I never got good coverage with Airtel,
3769,yhpVAki47RI,It&#39;s truly inspiring greatness. Keep it going with more knowledge add ons with current happenings,
3770,yhpVAki47RI,Vodafone is looteri company,
3771,yhpVAki47RI,Because jio tried to do monopoly. It&#39;s simcards do not operate in sim 2.,
3772,yhpVAki47RI,It is the responsibility of the people here to maintain a &quot;equally competitive company&quot; within the sector to ensure the quality of the other!!,
3773,yhpVAki47RI,Beating competition by providing worst network<br>Jio is still the leader<br>Bullshit airtel,
3774,yhpVAki47RI,Can you please start a series on different &quot;Industry Analysis&quot;,
3775,yhpVAki47RI,This is result of over analysing the situation and making a fool of yourself.<br><br>Jio is playing with market and do not want the blood strains on sleeve.,
3776,yhpVAki47RI,"Basically it is duopoly, ready to exploit !",
3777,yhpVAki47RI,JIO BROADBAND NO ISSUES.  AIRTEL friends find connection problems,
3778,yhpVAki47RI,Whatever joe might have done but still the network issues with Jio my god irritate so much airtel is still ok in terms of network but both are equally worse in my view always have so much issue with network and internet ☹️☹️,
3779,yhpVAki47RI,Abhi and neyu,
3780,yhpVAki47RI,"Great example!<br>This is the mistake Blackberry did<br>The moment they removed the exclusivity of BBM, they completely lost the war",
3781,yhpVAki47RI,"Pathetic network in BLR, I am Vodafone customer, beginning I just ported to jio postpaid. I made mistake. I&#39;m going back to Vodafone are Airtel!🙏",
3782,yhpVAki47RI,"The ecosystem has changed the whole perspective of business. As an IT employee I can also see several companies who are leveraging their ecosystems around the world.<br>Apple: iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iWatch, MacBook, Final Cut Pro, Siri etc.<br>Google: Google Workspace, Android, Google TV, Wear OS, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Assistant etc.<br>Microsoft: Office 365, Windows, Azure, MS Teams, Xbox, Power BI, MS SQL etc. Microsoft can easily create Windows for phones but that remains to be seen.<br>Adobe: Acrobat Reader, Photoshop, Lightroom, Premier etc.<br>Meta: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus.<br>Oracle: Java, Database, Cloud services etc.<br>Amazon: E-commerce, Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Kindle etc.<br>Disney: Marvel, Star Wars, Nat Geo, Disney, Hotstar, Disney+ etc.<br><br>Overall, you can only survive without an ecosystem if your product is better than the ecosystem product. Example: PlayStation, Spotify, Twitter, AWS etc.",
3783,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel pulled off a Jio,
3784,yhpVAki47RI,"Great Insights man. I learned a lot from the video. Though a lot us implicitly knew about the ecosystem created by Apple, but articulating it by breaking it down actually made it an actionable insight-entry level, Retainer &amp; upsells.",
3785,yhpVAki47RI,airtel charged 256 rs for 1GB . why will they go bankrupt?. they looted enough,
3786,yhpVAki47RI,content- 👍👍<br>background music - fed up ☹️☹️,
3787,yhpVAki47RI,i wish airtel would not have survived as well it has the worst network and poor costumer services just promising advertisement are gr8,
3788,yhpVAki47RI,I think i am choosing Airtel only because of its high speed that is the first and last reason and when jio lauch i choose it because of its less price even today jio has less price and Airtel has more speed but i choose idea because in my area it&#39;s speed is high and it is soo cheap and give free internet as well..😂😂,
3789,yhpVAki47RI,jIo destroyed others.that was gud.,
3790,yhpVAki47RI,"My first SIM was BSNL, then Vodafone ( Hutch) and then I switched to Airtel in 2010 and never switched! I never had to!",
3791,yhpVAki47RI,It&#39;s at the best interest of consumers to have all the 4 telecom players to be strong. Airtel &amp; Jio have been successful to have a good clout in the market<br>Despite huge debts &amp; AGR issue VI is continuing to provide service(which personally gave a pessimistic experience) <br>Government can resurrect BSNL to it&#39;s golden era of strength &amp; service standards by influx of Serious long-term investment(but i doubt it may happen),
3792,yhpVAki47RI,"So, the broadband actually saved the Airtel conglomerate",
3793,yhpVAki47RI,I don&#39;t think jio purposefully wants Airtel to stay in the market to avoid monopoly,
3794,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel didn&#39;t survive or beat Jio but got a kick up its back to get realistic in its price and quality thanks to Jio and simple economics of demand &amp; supply.,
3795,yhpVAki47RI,Kudos to you man 😅<br>Made an Airtel over Jio case study and got it sponsored by Moneycontrol (also owned by Reliance) 😂😂 This makes me love the Internet even more.<br>Such good content should never stop😃,

3798,yhpVAki47RI,Still the airtel ecosystem is very inferior and not user friendly compared to jio. Customer really struggles understanding the different schemes and the prices of airtel r too high compared to jio,
3799,yhpVAki47RI,Jio Jio Jio,
3800,fxjFr54LLOw,I love the pizza&#39;s from Domino&#39;s but it&#39;s to awkward that here in India they force the delivery partner to get the feedback instead of the management asking for the feedback,

3834,fxjFr54LLOw,Domino has changed the pizza quality in USA and improvised. Wonderful. Meanwhile in India the it’s still the old way. And 30 minutes or free always makes customers to buy. The pizza quality in India of dominos still sucks,
3835,fxjFr54LLOw,It&#39;s better to get learned then motivated,

3927,tI9fRLNmNkY,"PC market became commoditized and IBM sold the business to Lenovo back in 2005 &amp; Lenovo now leads the PC market. But it was not just Dell, it was Apple, Microsoft, and Dell along with some ordinary leadership in the &#39;80s that killed IBM. IBM reinvented itself (Several times since) but does not make consumer products anymore. Maybe they will once again when Quantum computers become mainstream.",
3928,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Why every video on YouTube has to say &quot;this killed that&quot;... Why can&#39;t you use some neutral words? Darn this clickbait stuff sucks, even if it gets more views, it sucks.",
3929,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Amazing content.👏👏👏<br><br>My free advise is to change the template of the video, as it was not made to watch at the first moment. It isn&#39;t got my focus.",
3930,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Don&#39;t use word kill, like a kid... It&#39;s looks bad. It will reduce impression on video. No one can kill anyone. May be just improved sales than a old company. How ever Dell is inspired by ibm. If no IBM there is no dell",
3931,tI9fRLNmNkY,Real life rocket singh,
3932,tI9fRLNmNkY,your voice irritates my ear... info acha tha,
3933,tI9fRLNmNkY,Don&#39;t compare Dell with IBM   <br>IBM is IBM  its more than 100years old company... those who know people still search for IBM laptops 😂 old is gold,
3934,tI9fRLNmNkY,Worth watching,
3935,tI9fRLNmNkY,dell sucks,

3939,tI9fRLNmNkY,Please make a video on Google.,
3940,tI9fRLNmNkY,You cannot keep such a threatening/ dubious  thunbnail,
3941,tI9fRLNmNkY,"And how the DELL fail ? like we are not see much divice like we have from HP, ASUS, ETC.",
3942,tI9fRLNmNkY,8 yrs of my Pentium chip dell laptop it has held up super strong,
3943,tI9fRLNmNkY,I know more about Computers than your Entire Species. So You can&#39;t Trick me.<br>Michael Dell is Some Canadian King. A PC Assembler. I could do that at age 13. Its like Lego.<br>It wasn&#39;t Dell that killed IBM.<br>It was your Father / God and those Borg / Avatar.<br>They Reverse engineered the X86 and Z80 CPU chip atomic silicon. Entire Galaxy working to Reverse engineer X86 and Z80.,
3944,tI9fRLNmNkY,"IBM was not killed by dell but by microsoft.  after inventing microchip, they were arrogant to thing that small will not grow big.",
3945,tI9fRLNmNkY,watching this video from my dell laptop😁😁😁😍😍,
3946,tI9fRLNmNkY,know what....m watching this video with a Dell Laptop 😆,
3947,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Sir, app video q nahi hindi m bante ho",
3948,tI9fRLNmNkY,"You will have to make a distinction between IBM and Dell where the former has professional accounts and Dell goes direct to customers. <br>Any business model where businesses deal with their customers directly are bound to succeed. Say cinema ticket. <br>What can be learnt from Dell is care for customers.  You never feel left out and brand recall is good. <br>That&#39;s why Amazon is doing well as it reaches home where family members recollect the experience. <br>For lessons,  to out against the best in the industry is tough as you need the support system. <br>In India any founder need the govt to support his enterprise.  How about US. <br>Next time cover the role of govt in the big companies establishment. Only then we can have a 360 degree idea about any business that succeeds in large scale.",
3949,tI9fRLNmNkY,Iam still on Dell lol and it still work and os is windows 7 and 500mb graphics card but 4gb ram and it is stilll lol ☠️☠️☠️☠️,
3950,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Dell might be an extraordinary company, but at present there products are below average and they start following the policy of quantity over quality and just keep on increasing prices of their low grade products.<br>Infact ASUS and HP are doing far better than dell in matter of quality.",
3951,tI9fRLNmNkY,Ur doing great work.. Love your videos!,
3952,tI9fRLNmNkY,Feels amazing listening to this while working for Dell itself &lt;3.,

3954,tI9fRLNmNkY,But I&#39;m regretting after buying Dell laptop 2 months back. It broke due to hinge issue and customer service is the worst. I&#39;m never buying Dell products again.,
3955,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Whatever stated in the video may have been true in past, dell has become the devil today. I have experienced this (I own a dell laptop) &amp; linustechtips has also proved this.",
3956,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Now, you need to watch Company Man&#39;s &quot;The decline of Dell&quot; after this.",
3957,tI9fRLNmNkY,"And it today&#39;s date you would buy a Dell only if it was a laptop coz their desktops are crap. Yes, institutions would buy from Dell coz they are able to bulk supply but individual consumers won&#39;t, unless you want to score a gpu on a fair-ish price along with the system. And most businesses go with Lenovo for some reason.",

3977,tI9fRLNmNkY,"One thing about Dell is eventually they were able to undercut the builders (myself being one of them back in the days). I used to build much better custom systems for my customers at less cost but once Dell got the costs down to where it was no longer profitable to &#39;build them&#39;, I started buying Dell&#39;s for my customers (albeit inferior to the systems I had been building in the past). There was a hitch as those low cost Dells we&#39;re hardly upgradable and cut corners with some &#39;mickey mouse&#39; stuff which meant they had a reduced usable lifetime (aka: disposable computers). Not bad for my business but not good for customers as they tended to hold on to those systems way beyond that &#39;stunted&#39; useful lifetime.<br><br>Generally, I don&#39;t buy Dells for myself (personal systems). However, they were ahead of the game on supporting Linux on their server lines which made them the &#39;go to&#39; for servers running linux and Dell has good support for Linux. However, this is changing and this &#39;niche&#39; is eroding. Like IBM, Dell is a company I suspect is a fading &#39;giant&#39; and really Lenovo has the edge. IBM is remaking itself and Dell will have to do the same before it&#39;s too late. <br><br>Ironically, much of the &#39;on-site&#39; support in the 90&#39;s I got from Dell were outsourced to IBM service people. I suspect Dell will need to get off the x86 processor monopoly or their fate will be tied to failing to diversify and will be undercut by less expensive ARM and possibly RISC-V power efficient alternatives. Dell is too tied to MS Windows and even MS has embraced Linux as Azure is their &#39;cash cow&#39; now and lumbering into ARM and we&#39;re getting to the point that the Linux desktop for the masses it&#39;s mature and the Windows monopoly will become a problem for this hardware company. Note: Dell does sell Laptops with Linux preinstalled but on the high end.... despite Linux usually entering in the recycle end (aka: EOL systems where Windows can&#39;t be upgraded and still be a useable system). This is a problem as Dell&#39;s desktops often die after the first 4 years (aka: disposable systems) and use cost cutting &#39;junk parts&#39; that have no long time support. AKA: not good for small businesses or countries looking to &#39;move away&#39; from the MS monopoly and reduce costs without losing productivity.",

3990,tI9fRLNmNkY,"very informative video as always . but do make a video on AMD VS INTEL in CPU market and how AMD rise dispite first gen Ryzen CPUs fail then came back with third gen Ryzen   CPUs and also talk about how they took a huge market share from Intel and became a value for money company and also explain their sales in 2019 ,2020 and 2021 briefly in CPU market .",

3993,tI9fRLNmNkY,i don&#39;t know.hp sells more in india I think..,
3994,tI9fRLNmNkY,how does just in time system make the delivery faster. Is that that they employ more skilled professionals since they have capital saved from not opting for inventory?,
3995,tI9fRLNmNkY,"One correction,  the statement of IBM don&#39;t own is misleading. I studied IBM PCs and clones for a year, and It was IBM who brought architecture of segregating Memory (ram), processor and internal and external drives for memory and made the architecture Free for all as a service to computer industry.  <br>Also when companies had policy of take all profits by making all by themselves, IBM had strict policy like SAP and few other companies of partnerships and growing together. they chose this route deliberately to see world as we see today. the bus to connect hardware, 8bit and 16 bit memory address were all ibms design. IBM still own the design and architecture we use today and allowed all to use and compete with IBM without issue. <br><br>IBM was the one who invented computer in first place and without them none of these technologies even existed. Also, IBM designed personal computers and helped computer industry thrive...so saying IBM failed and Dell did better than IBM and hence Dell better than IBM  is completely misleading. Even today Dell uses IBM architecture and has not invented new architecture. IBM  helped industry thrive and clones such as Dell and hp and acer and all other companies make money and boast about it..",

4106,dVtnSPZn6BU,Great,
4107,dVtnSPZn6BU,"As son of a successful LIC agent, I have heard many discussion between an agent with the client. And it is my strongest view that LIC has been successful simply because it was seen as a government (backed) organization. There was times in 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s where many investment companies would open up and siphon off people&#39;s money. Hence there was a trust on government backed LIC that helped agents to convince customers that their money was safe. I agree some of the other comments below that some lic branch officers were rude and behaved like any other government officer. But for common public, the safety of money was of utmost importance that helped LIC a lot.",

Neither the products provide adequate cover, nor do they provide any meaningful returns. Yes, the policies work very well for the agents, who get a handsome commission - so this gives them massive incentives to mis-sell - and most victims are poor and the middle class. LIC (mis)uses the trust model of your agent (most of the time, it will be your uncle or someone close in the family) to erode people&#39;s money.",

4149,dVtnSPZn6BU,Almost everyone employee of LIC undergo brainwash during their training. They suggest and promote only plans which will give you returns after decades. They don&#39;t inform customers about term-insurance/pure-risk plans. The worst part is these employees believe that pure-risk plans don&#39;t benifit customers.<br>LIC is a fraud company which makes buck loads of profit scamming the employees and customers.,
4150,dVtnSPZn6BU,"Agreed with everything but your point of good employee behaviour sounds vague because LIC employees also behave and talk rudely especially with rural people. Claim settlement duration is very poor in LIC as compared to its private counterparts like TATA AIA and Max Life where they settle claim within week, LIC often take months",

4159,dVtnSPZn6BU,Thank you for making such a quality content!,
4160,dVtnSPZn6BU,The other reason why lic is able to provide the claim money in time due to lic agents. Usually lic agents are from the same village or some random relative of the people. Causing easy enquiry and able to provide the provide amount easily directly tk beneficiaries.,

4164,dVtnSPZn6BU,Awesome explanation,
4165,dVtnSPZn6BU,loved lic but not customer because of affordability lic premiums are double than private companies,
4166,dVtnSPZn6BU,"Pls make a case study on some of the greatest PSUs in India like NTPC,IOCL,ONGC,POWERGRID etc...",
4167,dVtnSPZn6BU,that was actually a very bad step to acquire 245 private companies using law and force.  Thats why still very few percentage of people of india have insurance .,
4168,dVtnSPZn6BU,Thanks for the video. You&#39;re changing his we look at communicating for citizens who want to be more aware. Respect. 🙏,
4169,dVtnSPZn6BU,I must the LIC destroyed the meaning of Life Insurance because many have nightmare when policy get renewed or anything happens in between of premium payment time... In foreign countries people took an appointment of insurance officer to take an insurance... Now people don&#39;t have faith in the term insurance that&#39;s why they don&#39;t take it. I can confirm that in India 80% don&#39;t have insurance....,
4170,dVtnSPZn6BU,LIC is one of the most inefficient organization.. just check online premium and compare it with private players..LIC is a mechanism for government to milk any time..Most of the Failed OFS of PSUs were bailed by LIC...Mis selling is synonymous with LIC agents..sorry Ganesh not happy with glorifying such pathetic  organization,
4171,dVtnSPZn6BU,"Hi bro, please make a video about how to do a research like you do.",

4193,dVtnSPZn6BU,They can have a zoom call with LIC agent in Covid times. Its completely wrong to think people would go on to websites and purchase insurance in matter of 5 minutes. Insurance is still a costly affair and personal relationship with a agent gives us that secure feeling from inside who has been operating as an agent in our hyperlocal region for decades and have built relationship with our neighbours. Trust is a big factor for LIC. TATA brand is built on Trust and we know how the business is doing.,

4321,glHQPkrcf8A,Just wanted to add one more thing - IKEA products come as DIY and it gives the satisfaction and quality. I personally prefer assembling my own furniture rather than by doing someone else haphazardly.,
4322,glHQPkrcf8A,"Best thing about IKEA is customer service. Easy to build furniture by our own, color theme matches across products. And also they are budget friendly.",
4323,glHQPkrcf8A,"Sorry, was very late to see this Video....and very impressed by the way you explain it. Yes it do inspires...but I have 2 questions regarding Decoy effect....<br><br>1. Isn&#39;t the decoy price of 5 dollar difference rom the premium commodity understandable for any customers who think in marketing way? While those who don&#39;t think that way are surely not premium customers and they go for lower price commodity.<br><br>2. Well this one is for you... Well what you describe through these videos are marketing strategies which IKEA or any companies don&#39;t want to reveal. Don&#39;t they react against you by exposing their ideas even though they are academic studies, which might effect their business?",
4324,glHQPkrcf8A,"Hmmm, I’m not sure if it will work for the SaaS offering.",
4325,glHQPkrcf8A,Music is good,
4326,glHQPkrcf8A,Ikea still has better products over the available market.That makes it easy for people to walk into their store.,
4327,glHQPkrcf8A,"product quality of Ikea is pathetic, it will not make any money in India. India is the toughest market in the World<br><br>They have not studied anything in India Market and they are selling European products in India",
4328,glHQPkrcf8A,U r aristotle dude,
4329,glHQPkrcf8A,"But in this method , arent we wasting  a product which is of 60$ just to make customer select 65$ product",

4351,glHQPkrcf8A,I don&#39;t think ....i experienced this decoy effect in IKEA....I found wat I needed,
4352,glHQPkrcf8A,small doubt <br>what about the product that is left as a decoy strategy. doesn&#39;t it pile up or is there any strategy to sell such products as well.,
4353,glHQPkrcf8A,"I have been following IKEA for over 2 decades and I have never found the &#39;decoy&#39; pricing methodology in practice in any part of the world. Also IKEA has been studying the Indian market for nearly a decade before committing itself to enter the Indian mkt. As an architect, we have learnt the hard way the decoy effect of proposing designs in a known gradation of quality. We deliberately show a bad/insufficient design along with a probable good design such the Client recognises shortfalls of the inadequate design and appreciates the fulfillment of the those deficiencies in the &#39;better&#39; design - where the entire thing is orchestrated.",

4368,glHQPkrcf8A,This looks like a scam. The website doesn&#39;t have any contact address. Only one link which makes you pay. Once you pay the money the system crashes and doesn&#39;t find a page. There is no communication from the website on the email address which they have gathered before taking your money. I want a full refund otherwise I&#39;m reporting you to the cyber cell.,

4385,glHQPkrcf8A,"I am sorry but the decoy pricing method that you share in this video (while the science of it makes sense and is applicable) is not a good explanation of why IKEA is so successful. <br><br>The absolutely main reason for their success is brilliant design for the price they charge. Period. <br><br>In addition to this, minimalistic design, creative functionality, retail store design, amazing packaging and outstanding DIY implementation also add to their success.<br><br>For a example, try and find - in India - a carpenter-made TV cabinet for the same design and price that IKEA will sell you. <br><br>It’s (almost) not possible. <br><br>Their sales are amazing because they get it right on so many levels (yes, including the cultural sensitivity of their target markets), not just pricing. Their retail store design is marketing genius. It makes you go through the store in a way that exponentially increases your chances to buy on a whim or impulse.<br><br>Form + function + reasonable prices. That’s why they sell truck loads of their products.",

4389,glHQPkrcf8A,Why you can&#39;t become to entrepreneur?,
4390,glHQPkrcf8A,To whomever reading this here is a little pun... If you see the laptop section in the description you can see that it directs to think pad since it&#39;s suggested by think school 😃😀😂 I know it&#39;s not that funny,
4391,glHQPkrcf8A,Why on earth would anyone want digital and print? This kind of nonsense works for American consumers who are not really smart. Indian users will go for digital coz it’s cheap and there is no point of print as well for the same thing. <br>The decoy effect is also used for Soda or coke. Small Medium and Large where medium doesn’t make sense and Large doesn’t look like it’s too expensive compared to small. But smart consumers either buy what they need or not buy at all. I personally don’t care for sugar drinks but will pick small if I have to coz most of them have free refills anyway.,
4392,glHQPkrcf8A,Online shopping made this strategy obsolete,
4393,glHQPkrcf8A,"Great pricing lesson, thanks!!!",
4394,glHQPkrcf8A,I don&#39;t know why this guys buy popcorn at movies which was just 10rs on road and we never ate it on roads,
4395,glHQPkrcf8A,Apple uses the same strategy in its product lineup,
4396,glHQPkrcf8A,Well illustrated and facilitated learning.,
4397,glHQPkrcf8A,But if no one buys the decoy product then isn&#39;t it a waste in terms of dead inventory and the cost involved in manufacturing? Can the margins obtained from selling just budget and premium products be so much that they compensate for the zero sale of decoys?,

4412,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Now as Nykaa has raised, it has started fooling customers like most of other ecom sites. They delete negative reviews and most of the reviews are fake. You cannot trust their product ratings AT ALL.",
4413,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa is winning because almost everyone on insta wants to be a makeup artist or beauty influencer. Makeup artists charge 40k per hour and do 2 to 5 clients per day. And they claim they use international brands but use shid products like PAC. There used to makeup videos for free on YouTube few years back but now everyone sells courses and workshops.

4419,TCboTQr8Ecg,thanks brother for great guidance 🙏🏻 May God be with you and your team and families always 🙏🏻,
4420,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa is just another fraudster company that&#39;s all. On top of that they charge more money on products which can be bought at cheaper rate at other online store or on shops.,
4421,TCboTQr8Ecg,More profit more tax,
4422,TCboTQr8Ecg,Bcoz the founder is an MBA in finance and a ca so focus was always on finance and profitability,

4450,TCboTQr8Ecg,Dude please get your facts right.,
4451,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Nykaa USP which I feel as a buyer: better transperancy of brands, better transperancy of products (it shows all shades of foundation for example, so you know which shades will suit you: it allows to see how foundation will look on different skin colour with a picture), clear instruction on how to use the product, expiry dates and ingredients also. And last but not the least, their packaging is top class, it makes the buyers feel that Nykaa has made sure that products reach with minimal or no damage. It gives a sense of value, care which the customers have placed on the products.",
4452,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa has been reported of selling counterfeit impoted products and also withdrawing delivery services from several previously deliverable locations. Still people continue to shop at nykaa because of the perception that it has a higher standard to competing e-commerce retailers,

4454,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Just wanted to add a few points here and there, the horrible in-store Nykaa experience is a real thing. Sephora hires way more experienced people; Nykaa, especially in tier 2 and 3 cities, lacks on that aspect. And that remains a market to be tapped. However, one thing that worked with Nykaa&#39;s own ranges has been its community and their intensive market research. The shade range that they offer is exceptional for brown skin-tones. Brands like MAC which operate across the world and cater to all skin shades are pricier, and in the section that is experimenting with, or exploring makeup, a good below 500 product is amazing. <br>Oh and they have an entire section of website only for makeup artists, specific offers and product ranges.",
4455,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nyka is the Sephora of India,
4456,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nyka also sends duplicate products. And also half empty ones,
4457,TCboTQr8Ecg,"I&#39;m watching this video, after watching nykaa ad🔥",
4458,TCboTQr8Ecg,Beauty products themself are nonsense products. Day by day people will stop using these products.,
4459,TCboTQr8Ecg,I think soon nyaka will be swallowed by Amazon or flipkart. No unique value except inventory model. Fake products and customer awareness soon will be addressed by Amazon.,
4460,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa packing is good...,

4466,TCboTQr8Ecg,I love nykaa stores. They leave their products open and let the customer choose and check those by their own. It&#39;s very much comfortable. We get to choose what we want without having the seller pressure. And that&#39;s how we ended up buying what i really want not what the seller want us to buy.,
4467,TCboTQr8Ecg,@think school tell me what product have you bought from nykaa and what did you like the most in the product?,

4587,er752AxyziE,"Would like to add few more points on Bessemer.Though Bessemer Convertor(1856) was revolutionary for Steel Industry it had several cons. Some info on Bessemer Convertor :<br>📌Bessemer is one of the earliest form of steel making. There are two types of bessemer process :<br>1. Acid bessemer process<br>2. Basic bessemer process<br><br>🚀Acid / Basic represents the nature of refractory lining.<br>Acid bessemer process was the first to be found and later on basic bessemer process was found. Basic bessemer process is also known as Thomas process of steelmaking.<br><br>✅1.Acid bessemer process -<br>In steelmaking the impurities to be removed are C,Si, Mn and P.<br>Here C is a gas so no issues in its removal. Mn is also basic in nature so it is also removed without difficulty. But oxides of Si and P are acidic in nature , so they cannot be lowered in acid bessemer process. <br>The steel has high amount of Si, P and N after completion of process which is kinda bad. <br><br>✅2. Basic bessemer process :<br>Now since the lining is basic in nature Si, P can be lowered here unlike acid bessemer process. But still the problem of high N content in steel persists here due to usage of air as a oxidising agent.  Thus, Bessemer Process was later on replaced quickly and BOF became the go to SM process!<br><br>For more info feel free to check out the SM series here: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/metallurgy_daily/p/CR67KzPDpBq/?utm_medium=copy_link"">https://www.instagram.com/metallurgy_daily/p/CR67KzPDpBq/?utm_medium=copy_link</a>",

4616,urLoa8PkQpU,"Poor vlogger !! Failed to research in Kerala ! 😂😂😂😂 check the Kerala brands - Kalyan , Bhima , Malabar , Jos allukkas !!! You will get contents for 5+ episodes !!",
4617,urLoa8PkQpU,Gotta feel sorry for those marwadis,
4618,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq doesn&#39;t not offer 1 month free investment from them in harvest schemes. This is verified today.,
4619,urLoa8PkQpU,"I think you lack bit of a knowledge, you did your research only on the brand but not the trusted players of the market, Tanishq is a brand that&#39;s been propelled by Tata.<br><br>I hope you are aware about the BIS mark and hallmark and various other certification. Tanishq is just a fad, will eventually die out and give in to the local players. May not happen overnight, will definitely happen.<br>Quick Tip: next time do your research from both ends. Easy to sit on a mic and blabber what you find on the internet, next time dig deeper and go beneath atleast 2-3 layers of the market.",
4620,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq is for upper middle class but they have recently started focusing on low ticket  customer for jewellery by buying caratlane for 300-400 crores (for middle and lower middle),
4621,urLoa8PkQpU,"Over decades Jewelers of India have successfully brainwashed Indians into believing that buying gold jewelry is an investment rather than an expense, and have successfully made fools of a vast majority of Indians. Tanishq is no different. If you want to invest in gold, buy stock in gold mining firms, gold coins and bricks. Buying jewelry is a sure way to make a loss. Jewelers profit when one buys or sells jewelry.  Don&#39;t trust any jeweler.",
4622,urLoa8PkQpU,That was great man.. it was insightful 👏👏,
4623,urLoa8PkQpU,"Being in the jewelry industry since1989, most of the points that you have mentioned are agreeable, But I don&#39;t agree that local seller looted their loyal customers. There might be a few scammers but not most as you have said. unfortunately, one rotten apple makes the whole bunch look bad.<br>But there&#39;s a new trend of scammers with Lab-Grown Diamonds, How they mislead cousotmers into believing that Lab-grown is somehow as valuable as Natural diamond by comparing both of them side by side, just to sell you Lab-grown. I think that needs to be pointed out in this diamond jewelry industry.",
4624,urLoa8PkQpU,"Saw this video on youtube incognito, and finally, I subscribed and commented, I appreciate the hardship that went into making this video and case study. My mind blown.",
4625,urLoa8PkQpU,"&quot; killed&quot; is a wrong word. You must not have done any regular dealings with the local jewelers. If you had, you will not have used that word. <br>They always have a tendency of cheating the customer one way or the other, while on the other hand Tanishq has absolutely fair dealing.<br>You can compare Tanishq with local jewelers in as many aspects you want. May it be Purity of the gold, carat value declared with that of actual value, workmanship, after sales service and many more. You&#39;ll find tanishq better. <br>So a customer who can buy so expensive items, would always go for the best.",
4626,urLoa8PkQpU,The cheating thing for gold in local jwellers is very very true trust me,
4627,urLoa8PkQpU,"I am grateful to Tanishq for introducing the concept of a caratmeter wherein the customers can have the purity of their gold checked and evaluated....yes they are a brand and their making charges are high, no doubt but till Tanishq came into existence all &#39;small&#39; jewellers simply took the customers for a ride.....this is my personal experience...",
4628,urLoa8PkQpU,"So called small jewellers dug their own grave to some extent. in the 90s it was common that they cheat. they fleeced my family by selling us 18k gold bangles saying it it is 22 and charged for that too. happened a lot in many circles with diamonds and gold. ppl find branded stuff ugly and expensive but they feel at least genuine hoga. unfortunately, overtime its clear that that too is not reliable.",
4629,urLoa8PkQpU,Absolutely Stupid conclusion. When and where did it kill small jewellers? Extremely over priced products. quality of diamonds is pathetic. It&#39;s the most useless and pathetic brand ever. What are you high on Think school?,
4630,urLoa8PkQpU,Please do a research on offline mobile shop economy,
4631,urLoa8PkQpU,"I bought a gold ring in Tanishq for 16k after 4 years the it turned into fake gold. So, the time will let you know what kind of gold you bought.",
4632,urLoa8PkQpU,LOVE YOUR VIDEO,
4633,urLoa8PkQpU,We all know how most jewellers in India earn so much money 🌚,
4634,urLoa8PkQpU,After the controversy on Diwali ad. I tried different brands and showrooms and surprisingly they have much better products with huge price difference. And now days every good jeweller gave you guaranty card of purity so trust issue is also resolved....,
4635,urLoa8PkQpU,"Not sure about quality. But making charges is very high. No idea whether others play with purity?  Any expert opinion please. 2 days back, wr visited The counter",
4636,urLoa8PkQpU,I think maker of this video has not visited Laxmi Road in Pune and Dadar Mumbai (or Sarafa in any other city).<br><br>Tanishq has hardly killed anyone. Just visit above mentioned places a week before Diwali,
4637,urLoa8PkQpU,Amazing content!,
4638,urLoa8PkQpU,"Boss u r outdated , Now they don’t provide 1 month discount.",
4639,urLoa8PkQpU,Being a tanishq super fan ..i always felt happy to buy from tanishq .it&#39;s a tata product and its worth it,
4640,urLoa8PkQpU,it is not a worth store for buying. you don&#39;t  get value for money.,
4641,urLoa8PkQpU,Smalll jwellers loot people may b they charge less but they fraud with amount of gold that they put in gold aftr using it for a while for months the gold colour start fading and look almost look lik brass,
4642,urLoa8PkQpU,TanishQ is indian company owned by TATA,
4643,urLoa8PkQpU,"Agree with Sindhuja, it did&#39;nt kill anyone. Even today traditional jewellers are doing well and their designs are improving. Think School team needs to conduct more  research on its topics.",
4644,urLoa8PkQpU,bro this guy is Very good analyst,
4645,urLoa8PkQpU,i visited that store once. everything was overpriced. title is a lie!,
4646,urLoa8PkQpU,Ad,
4647,urLoa8PkQpU,small jwellers are doing well tanishiq cannot make difference to them,
4648,urLoa8PkQpU,I think tanishq doesn&#39;t give 916 gold,
4649,urLoa8PkQpU,Wholesome content. Kudos to you.,
4650,urLoa8PkQpU,Only good showrooms normal design gold with a high making charges,
4651,urLoa8PkQpU,But Making Charges are high at tanishq compared to others,
4652,urLoa8PkQpU,I am from Karnataka. Tanishk is not famous,
4653,urLoa8PkQpU,"why all indian youtubers use foreigners to convey sonethung. for example here the youtuber us ss peajing abiut Indian oublic but showing a non Indian public at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urLoa8PkQpU&amp;t=8m42s"">8:42</a>",
4654,urLoa8PkQpU,Tab to MEESHO v kam nehi hai. . pura small business kharab kr k rakha hua hai,
4655,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq  making charge is very high.i never go to taneshq.,
4656,urLoa8PkQpU,Good job by Tanishq I hope they get you too,
4657,urLoa8PkQpU,I think<br>They in fact make people value local Jewellers more as they are way too overpriced and not up to the mark!! <br>This time not good research on your part!!!,
4658,urLoa8PkQpU,"Please visit Kerala Tanishq is nothing there.. Bhima, Kalyan, Malabar, Joy Alukkas, Josco etc are popular..",
4659,urLoa8PkQpU,Mainly through overpricing items. Collection is extremely unique no doubt.,
4660,urLoa8PkQpU,Try to make video within 10 minutes..,
4661,urLoa8PkQpU,"un understand able videos Sydney Australia <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>",
4662,urLoa8PkQpU,Well .. with Tata brand and Tanishq run like a corporate. At least when it comes to purity of Gold . Trust of gold is pivotal..I think that’s where Tanishq scores. Gold trust,
4663,urLoa8PkQpU,My mother visited tanisq but didn&#39;t buy anything instead bought from a local jeweler,
4664,urLoa8PkQpU,design to h hi nhi bakwas aur boring hai unnecessary show off hai bas,
4665,urLoa8PkQpU,"Most local jewellers sell gold coins of 99.95% purity. Tanishq sells 99.99 % purity coins. For that difference, they charge Rs 5000 extra",
4666,urLoa8PkQpU,Ground reality is something different. In my town it has been closed down,
4667,urLoa8PkQpU,"Small Indian jewellers are notorious for cheating customers ,there is no guarantee to the quality of gold they sell and they are not at all reliable . Tanishq did a huge favour to consumers",
4668,urLoa8PkQpU,Kyun sirf Tanishq hi reliance jo gali gali rashan de rahe h dmart bhi,
4669,urLoa8PkQpU,"Not at all Tata is still a underdog in jewellery business. The big players are kerala based jewellers like Kalyan ,Malabar, joy allukas ,josco and many more.",
4670,urLoa8PkQpU,Stupid video..it is local gold traders who get more business because of trust..big brands like this are good in advertisement and they get only upmarket clients who are not even 0.001% of population,
4671,urLoa8PkQpU,If you were Tanisqe jewellery you don&#39;t have to wear sarees pallu just show off everything if u wear Tanishq brand.<br>We Indian love other Indian jewelry. We hate deshdhrohi padukon.,
4672,urLoa8PkQpU,Never forget VARDMAN jwellers. Analysis is necessary and u are lacking in that,
4673,urLoa8PkQpU,described nicely,
4674,urLoa8PkQpU,My family still goes to family jewellers not these big corporations,
4675,urLoa8PkQpU,HI EVERYBODY...,
4676,urLoa8PkQpU,"No, it&#39;s not true",
4677,urLoa8PkQpU,"Ghanta!! Tanishq has 2 store near my house and I have never witnessed rush over there, other brands like Lalitha, GRT, Malabar are doing much much better then them.",
4678,urLoa8PkQpU,In Chennai local GRT brand that runs for now around 70 years is far more better than Titan,
4679,urLoa8PkQpU,Not a good decision to go for gold ornaments there ! Huge disappoint! Switched back to known local manufacturers,
4680,urLoa8PkQpU,"Really surprise to see this video. Tanishq has not even captured total 5% of jwelly market and it 95% is still owned by small jwellers, Get your fact corrected.",
4681,urLoa8PkQpU,I guess this video is a little too outdated as the gov itself has took very good steps like hallmarking to improvise trust in the local jeweler rather than brands. Bcoz branding is causing waisting peoples money which could indeed be used to buy more gold. Secondly daimond is not what indians want to buy you should do a little more research. And be careful something big will come in a year or two which will empower the local jewels more over these brands with a more market trust and very big competition for all such brands😁😁😁😁,
4682,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq didn’t kill anything😂😂😂 gold prices have decreased sale,
4683,urLoa8PkQpU,"Lol.. I am amazed you are not worried by entire economy being killed by two business houses! And if you will bother to check Tanishq prices, you will realise that not more than 1% Indian population can afford Tanishq products.",
4684,urLoa8PkQpU,Far Fetched.,
4685,urLoa8PkQpU,Local jewellers are far better in every expects.. the after sale service they only give us. If you purchase something from tanishq and after 1 month it got damaged then they will suggest you to exchange the product and pay making charges of the new product..<br> Isse chutiya banana nhi kahenge to kya kahenge.. vo us fact ko customer ko nhi samjhynge ki aap exchange karte hai to ek to purane wale saman ka making charges+ GST loss jayega aur new saman jo lenge usme fir se making charges aur GST lagega.. vo aisa gol gol samjhynge hame ki sir aapka koi deduction thori kia ja rha hai bas making charges lagenge aur exchange ho jayega....<br>  Wahin local jwellers bahut jyada damaged jwellery ko bhi repair karwa dete hai aur suggest karte hai ki jitna din aur pahan sakti hn pahan lijiye kuki nuksan to hona hi hai making charges ka abhi karo ya baad me...<br>Tanishq sirf kisi tarah meetha meetha bol kar lootna jaanta hai,
4686,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq kuch nahi kar raha local jewellery wale lootere hote hai Jyadatar.. dang se chek Karo to bilkul Sona nahi nikalta unki jewellery me..,
4687,urLoa8PkQpU,"Well BHIMA is still number 1 in kerala, i don&#39;t think thanishq is in top 3 or 5",
4688,urLoa8PkQpU,Tatika padukone,
4689,urLoa8PkQpU,Don&#39;t make false statements. Your analysis is wrong. Skilled working small jewelry shops are ever green and dependable. Bharath people will prefer small jewelry shops rather than corporate ones. So work out on a topic deeply and then make analysis...,
4690,urLoa8PkQpU,"In kerala atleast we have ton of brands like Kalyan, Bhima, Joy Alukkas, Malabar gold , Josco and many others. Tanishq will be the last in line if none of the above shops are open on a holiday😂😂. Their making charges are ridiculous.",
4691,urLoa8PkQpU,Seriously cause of that purity meter &amp; gold harvest scheme now I only buy gold from Tanishq brand...he pointed out the same thing...very well researched kudos to you &amp; your channel 😍❤️,
4692,urLoa8PkQpU,Buy a hallmarked jwellery from your local trusted jwellers...now a days it&#39;s not easy to cheat if you are aware of the norms..... Branded showrooms have v higher making charges and other charges...,
4693,urLoa8PkQpU,Khazana and lalitha is not charging wastage,
4694,urLoa8PkQpU,Their commercials are disappointing. They are trying to woo A small set of customer group ignoring large. Well it is just matter of few days to complete rejection. This business is much different than other tata brands. Stands out clearly for trying to be woke,
4695,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq not good,
4696,urLoa8PkQpU,Only on Purity Tanisq is assured compared to others. Others are saying 22  karat but purity is not maintained so.,
4697,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq is bad,
4698,urLoa8PkQpU,"you need a gold shop in every major town in jalgaon, maharastra because we have a ritual during marriage that we collect the gods (gold sheets with kul dev engraved on it) and polish them and then the Devatas participate in the marriage",
4699,urLoa8PkQpU,"Local owners used to cheat a lot, they will charge for 22k but when we went to tanishq and senco both said only 18k... So it&#39;s breach of trust",

We should have been far ahead of Japan and Korea by now. Monopolies hindered the progress for nearly 50 years.,

One is Swami Vivekananda traveling to parliament of religions in Chicago via Japan, Canada and then to land in U.S. Another person is Jamshetji Tata, travelling to the west to study industrial sites. Swamiji comes to know of Jamshetji being onboard and meets him. After they get to know each other, Swamiji suggests to Jamshetji to start a company that is into research and development apart from the companies he already had. Swamiji says this research will help India in the long run. They soon reach their ports of departure. Years later in 1909, Jamshetji with help of Krishna Raja wadiyar , the then maharajah of Mysore establishes the Indian institute of science. Imagine how a sanyasi along with a great industrialist kick starts indian R&amp;D center.",

4775,OEB_UviHDq0,"i want to make one request to you. Please try to make a video regarding cons of British rule in India taking in consideration the textile industry as a main focus. By this we may come to know that upto what extent our national textile industry got harmed by British Rule &amp; by what percentage advancements of British rule helped it to Regain its power for example , as you mentioned in this video that railway was beneficial for any industry like textile for transport. So simply they killed our textile or got control over it or as they came we got better ? thats the question boss...Hope you got my point &amp; request....<br>Thanks regards",
4776,OEB_UviHDq0,That will be inside the British premises,

4797,OEB_UviHDq0,"He built tata his business , he didn&#39;t build India .",
4798,OEB_UviHDq0,True gem of India is TATA not Ambani. TATA believes in growth of the nation as a whole on contrary Ambani believes in market monopoly at the cost of nation&#39;s destruction.,
4799,OEB_UviHDq0,A movie/ web series should be made on TATA&#39;s ...,

4819,lSF--3zgjKQ,"Fake it untill you make it, excellent case study",
4820,lSF--3zgjKQ,the unethical business about trapping poors in debt was pointing to Byju&#39;s 🙂,

4852,lSF--3zgjKQ,I think he used fear for ditto in the same way. Fear of not getting the money after the mishap. But here it&#39;s a ethical marketing as long as ditto do what they say. Wonderful video.🙌,
4853,lSF--3zgjKQ,Byjus is doing exactly the same by fearing poor or middle class people to sell tablet,
4854,lSF--3zgjKQ,I hate it when Marketing guys get the credit when the real work is done by Advertising guys!,
4855,lSF--3zgjKQ,And teachers used it to make sales,
4856,lSF--3zgjKQ,"Amazing insight, man! If you ever decide to make a video about FMCG again, I would love to know the reason as to why so many products cost significantly less in smaller packaging and sachets than their larger counterparts",

4903,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Proud to be a MARWADI ☺️,
4904,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Ive never felt this hungry,
4905,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"They will rise and fall if they are into retail food and beverages. Business with lack of hospitality.<br>And currently that is what lacking in haldiram retail outlets.<br>Understaffed and lack of business process.<br>A customer has to go the counter to get a ticket for intended purchase items, then take the ticket to cash counter for payment and then come back to the same counter and show the receipt and wait for average 30min to buy a kilo of sweet.<br>More than happiness it brings frustration to consumers mind.<br>If only payment process is made easier and buy experience pleasure.<br>And above all I see only box and cartons of packed food when I step in shop.leaves me a memory of godown rather a sweet shop.",
4906,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Its not दंगर its महाराज डुंगर सिंह जी name …from there he took डुंगर,
4907,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Nice video but I&#39;m curious about the rumors of it being sold to another entrepreneur by the current generation...?!! 🤔,
4908,Z7P-t_yc8gE,The video is good…however there are some mistakes…<br>1. Bikaner bhujiya were never made by besan. They were always made moth daal.<br>2. The name of then king was Doongar singh. Doongar means mountain. Since the king was a huge man physically.,
4909,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"Very poor taste of titles for your videos. Sensationalizing, disrespecting and feeding fluff as content that doesn&#39;t substantiate the chosen title.",
4910,Z7P-t_yc8gE,I&#39;m a little confused here. Bro said he first gained trust of Marathi customers by selling them known dishes(like the South Indian food) and then moved towards selling unknown dishes like the sweet delicacies. But earlier in the video he said that he gained traction by selling kaju katli which was very new to his customers?,
4911,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"Success depends on the actions or steps you take to achieve it.  Show me a man with no investment and I&#39;ll tell you how long it takes to fail.

4918,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"I mean, in India",
4919,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"I doubt if Haldiram made 1 crore profit let alone 1,000 crores.",
4920,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Haldiram is a Snack Company and very few people buy and eat snacks and that too rich snacks.,
4921,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Great work bro! Thanks for sharing all these helpful videos!🙌🏼❤️,
4922,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Accurate Pronunciation of dungar is <b>डूंगर</b>,
4923,Z7P-t_yc8gE,5000 crore is not even a billion dollars how can u say billions <br>I should say crores,
4924,Z7P-t_yc8gE,It is pronounced as &quot; डूंगर &quot; in hindi !,
4925,Z7P-t_yc8gE,It is at least a 25000 crore company now,
4926,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Haldiram<br><br>Ram Ram,
4927,Z7P-t_yc8gE,My favorite😍😍,
4928,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Haldiram is having turnover in multiples of Rs 5000 crores. So your video is even more valuable,
4929,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Good reasearch and case study even for business leaders,
4930,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"False information, I remember going to Haldiram when I was a kid in year 1987-88 with my family at Chandni Chowk, and according to you in 1990 Haldiram was just 11 years old and working at a bhujia shop. So how can it possible that a big shop in prime location like Chandni Chowk named after that 11 years old?  Even on their website it mentioned 1937 as the founded year.",
4931,Z7P-t_yc8gE,watching this while eating haldiram mung dal,

4935,Z7P-t_yc8gE,U r really awesome... But if u go a lil slower it vll be best,
4936,Z7P-t_yc8gE,i think haldiram is still undervalued...compared to cureent date overvalued starups,
4937,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Haldiram&#39;s Kaju katli is too good ....🤗🤗,
4938,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Its Good that you are showing advertising and brand promotions only at the end of your content.<br>God bless you.,
4939,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Bengal to say.,
4940,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Thank you for this discussion,
4941,Z7P-t_yc8gE,It is always a case of a business venture once it crosses its boundaries the growth is self propelled...Brand name&#39;s popularity will do the trick...Like TATA Bata Amul Golgate.etc..Haldirams are addictive especially Bhujia ..so once consumed stay a consumer for life..In politics Modi is a brand ...Movies Rajinikanth... business tycoon Adani...,
4942,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"Haldiram despite selling pricy products uses Palm oil which comes from destroying rainforests in Malaysia. It also uses cotton seed oil which in turn is GM seed oil as 95% of the cotton grown in India is GM. Its packged products has quite good number of flavouring agents, colouring agents and chemicals many of which are carcinogenic and banned in EU. They also generate copious amount  of plastic waste. My two cents - buy local, package free or make it at home.",
4943,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Bro you are not right the journey you told was worng m employee at haldiram and it&#39;s not a true story if you dnt know then dnt naraate coz you are bit correct but not totally,

4948,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"9.34, i would say tis is the magic of ur explanation 👍",
4949,Z7P-t_yc8gE,I expect Bombay Special Mixture (dal mix) from Haldirams. No other brand tastes like Haldiram,

4960,Z7P-t_yc8gE,a case study on how upi is created,
4961,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Watching this while eating Haldiram&#39;s bhujia and starting a new business :) The daughter in law should be given due credit for coming up with great recipes. She just didn&#39;t have enough time/knowledge so she could run the business alongside her in-laws. I hope the coming generation of women get to run their own businesses.,
4962,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Not dangar... It&#39;s dungar,

4967,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Haldiram was 11 years old in1990 ??? seriously??,
4968,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"Amazing video and very essential for a product manager to get to the ground level to understand the customer. @Thinkschool, i would like to understand your strategy toward conducting such case studies.",

5083,vkrBQCQLQG0,"Everyone in the comments thinks that by watching this video they have gained knowledge of the video game industry. BUT THIS VIDEO HAS A LOT OF MISINFORMATION AND HE HAS CHOSEN TO IGNORE A LOT OF DATA. Let me break it down :<br>1) He says that console &amp; PC has very less accessibility and very limited market. That is completely false. Consoles are used in 250M households around the world which is more than amount of households that have Netflix(200M) . More than 3 Billion people play video games today. That is more than half of the connected world. 2 billion of those play on mobile. 1 billion play on console and PC. How can you call a market with 1 billion consumers limited? And in 2 Billion mobile market, 1 billion are from India( around 400-450M players) and third world countries where console and PC penetration is low. Approximately less than 1 billion who play mobile are in areas where console &amp; PC penetration is moderate to high like US, UK, Europe and the west. Even though there are 1 billion gamers in those areas, there are actual statistics that show that those people spend more on console &amp; PC than in mobile. One of The biggest fallacy in this video is that he calls $100B top-line business &quot;limited market&quot;. He says that $300-400 consoles are barriers to entry while ignoring that on average people in New York spend $300 PER WEEK ON Groceries. People in the west spend thousands of dollars on phones and you call consoles expensive? Consoles are only expensive in countries like India, Brazil, Africa etc.. because of low income and high import taxes, not surprising because only 5% percent of mobiles sold in India are more than ₹40,000($550). Consoles are inexpensive devices in the west and that&#39;s why almost every household has a console or a PC and why in countries like India you don&#39;t find a console or a PC in any of the households.",

5144,kotO3sUv-xo,The way you describe the content my personal feel is no need or very minimal mems are ok...great work god bless learning a lot from your videos and really understanding the complex things in a simple manner.,
5145,kotO3sUv-xo,PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO ON TATA ELXSI,
5146,kotO3sUv-xo,Like this post,
5147,kotO3sUv-xo,Please don&#39;t add memes. They spoils the overall experience and degrade your standard. <br>You did the same mistake as you have mentioned --कॉक्रोचेस् in a pizza hall. It&#39;s disgusting. Please let think school be a think school. Seedhi baat no bakwas,
5148,kotO3sUv-xo,You dont need these memes to make video interesting.<br>Please dont add memes,

5150,kotO3sUv-xo,One suggestion: Please do not insert those useless memes forcefully and make it funny. It undermines the tone of a serious and informative video. I&#39;ll go to Instagram if I want to see memes.,
5151,kotO3sUv-xo,Great vidio as usual. But one suggestion-  plz don&#39;t put comedy fillers. They interrupt the flow and are cheap as your vidios are classy.,
5152,kotO3sUv-xo,Thanks,
5153,kotO3sUv-xo,Tata&#39;s the real gem&#39;s of INDIA. I respect &amp; admire Ratan Tata so much !!!!!,
5154,kotO3sUv-xo,you nailed it with murthy.... i loved  that ad,
5155,kotO3sUv-xo,"oh man, these memes are forcefully inserted. Takes away all the charm and attention from the main content.",
5156,kotO3sUv-xo,I am using Voltas AC but i must say i am sad with thier after sales service. My AC keeps on showing &quot;df&quot; and there is some sort of ice accumulation inside it. <br><br>I remembered my Samsung Ac was too good. It lasted for more than a decade.,
5157,kotO3sUv-xo,@Thinkschool u are doing amazing work...every time comes with a new story to learn .,
5158,kotO3sUv-xo,"Voltas Air Condition is very costly, so  I bought Heir Ac.",
5159,kotO3sUv-xo,Bro your Zomato perspective is wrong. Feature does not make company great.,

5162,kotO3sUv-xo,I personally do not like voltas.. For its quality..🙃,
5163,kotO3sUv-xo,bro its not dadra its dadar,
5164,kotO3sUv-xo,The video would have been better without memes,
5165,kotO3sUv-xo,I purchased Voltas considering it’s made in india brand. But on all boxes of outdoor and indoor units had made in China label. No diff. between Chinese and Voltas brand.,
5166,kotO3sUv-xo,Don&#39;t put those memes in between 😗,
5167,kotO3sUv-xo,You have a great story telling talent 👍,
5168,kotO3sUv-xo,Now in 2016 when i constructed my house i bought the expensive inverter bluestar ac for 45k rs and for another room Voltas 3 star ac for 26k rs. You know which one still cools well even if not serviced properly the VOLTAS is still working although with some noise. The bluestar inverter has been done servicing at the correct time but still causes problem. Now i switched to natural airflow method by installing insect net on windows and opening all of them after night time when pollution level is low for good air circulation because the outside air temp is itself 26Degrees at night during many days even during summer in coimbatore area.<br>Voltas is best and cheap AC for sure.,

5211,JqSeQ3c4_qI,Very good coverage,
5212,JqSeQ3c4_qI,"MDH commercials are note worthy. The story is truly Indian and as simple as giving a masala powder in a packet has such groundwork based on it. <br>We all know Aachi, Everest etc.,  but MDH and the sincerity that goes with it is memorable. <br>The investment behind quality supplies is enormous. Outsourcing in food is a recipe for disaster. <br>We got a legend and in today&#39;s startup culture shall we see his spirit again in the products we use is a question. <br>Still I appreciate your effort in bringing the story behind a true Indian. Jai Hind!",

Y&#39;all are gonna be so surprised how things turn out within a decade.<br>The foremost requirements for being a superpower is economic superiority which, today, comes from technology and innovation. India is a dud in both.<br>Those advocating that India is high tech better familiarise themselves with the current world tech scenarios in battery tech, additive manufacturing, BCIs, organic printing etc. These and many more are areas of which India is not even aware of, let alone have a presence.<br>Our tech is borrowed, we are not innovative, we don&#39;t give any manufactured product to the world. Made in India is NOT a mark of reliability in ANY manufactured product.<br>Despite being a nation of 1.4 billion people and having NO sizeable constraints, our level of industrialization is minimal &amp; we are becoming a service oriented economy...that too for internal consumption. Most of our start ups are in fintech &amp; designed for use in India only.<br>India can NEVER become a superpower. Not unless the Indian society changes and people start getting empathetic. This is the starting point to innovation &amp; growth. We develop empathy as a society, then, maybe in two or three generations, we can start talking about ruling the world.<br>Till then, such stupid talks are only lip service to our cognitive dissonance, which is there aplenty in all Indians, thanks to our overinflated egos.<br>What we don&#39;t realise is how precarious the situation is becoming. The West is aggressively moving towards automation in ALL areas. Which means heavy reduction in manual tasks, leading to lesser jobs. India can expect a lot of expats returning home within a decade.<br>The world&#39;s top soil is eroding. Post 2050, India will start losing its single biggest global advantage area of food production as better farming tech grows abroad.<br>India will be used by the world as a market only...like it&#39;s being used today. People will be paid highly for working in foreign owned companies that have set up shop in India. But despite having a high salary will live hand to mouth because everything will be very expensive.<br>The future of India is high unemployment, high crime &amp; govt controlled living. The time has almost run out.

Youth leaving 5%-10% of them others are going down the path of hatred thus not focusing on learning any skill + violence and hate along with poor infrastructure led to company not considering  setup  in india. Also the issue of brain drain which at some point of time was a great matter of concern is being neglected today when this issue is very dominant. Most of the highly talented person the top 1 percent of the 1 percent actually leave this country and contribute to economy of foreign nation. India being a superpower was a reality that could have been achieved if our country had the same pace and perception when this was a main issue but for now it&#39;s far from reality and if what&#39;s happening -the most concerning issue of division and hate propaganda is not stopped this dream would remain a dream .",

This is one of the reason people using Airtel for now but they will jump to jio fiber connection the moment it&#39;s available in the missing areas.<br>Jio has better ott options, bandwidth and speed without interruptions. Where in if Airtel as you said they have tied up with local internet providers has interruptions..<br>And your last point on monopoly now make sense is to why Jio is not cater in other sectors within my area 😃",
5433,yhpVAki47RI,"I have a doubt. Can one entry level product act as the retainer for a pre-existing entry level product? If so, how does it work?",
5434,yhpVAki47RI,In 2010 people.were paying 148 inr for 1 GB airtel data in a month<br><br>In 2020 people paying 200-300 for unlimited data for JIO<br>Jio MADE REVOLUTION in market,
5435,yhpVAki47RI,Fun Fact - This Man Is promoting  Airtel Indirectly  😜😜,
5436,yhpVAki47RI,"Airtel service is bad now also overcharge for everything,Jio is awesome in every way guys",
5437,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel Vodafone an idea could have given the rate they are giving today but they didn&#39;t and continue to charges almost 300 rupees for per GB of 4G data! It&#39;s only a great thing that jio saved us from there loot.,
5438,yhpVAki47RI,congratulation for 2M subscriber,
5439,yhpVAki47RI,VI has the best internet speed as compared to both Jio and Airtel,
5440,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel’s sim data is POS but Wi-Fi is pretty cool though.,
5441,yhpVAki47RI,"Jio&#39;s ecosystem will always be bigger then Airtel&#39;s. And Jio made internet to be a common man&#39;s luxury. Rest since both are Indian companies so I want both of them to thrive n get outsider companies, (thriving in various other sectors) to go from here like farming, toys, Mobile phones etc. We have lot to reclaim so both the Indian giants should flourish exponentially",
5442,yhpVAki47RI,"Its also true that the way Youtubers link videos one after the other at the end is equivalent to a Business ecosystem<br><br>btw, want more of such content❤",
5443,yhpVAki47RI,Microsoft let flourish apple to avoid monopoly problems. even bill gates helped Steve jobs in doing that. it&#39;s good to not have monopoly.,
5444,yhpVAki47RI,But today airtel is funking us,
5445,yhpVAki47RI,Sorry to say Airtel stands no where before Jio,
5446,yhpVAki47RI,"i live in the outskirt of a small city, only broadband option i had, BSNL, ateast they were able to provide me and probably even saved my job, Jio, airtek not even close.",
5447,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel was caught poorly capitalized with less than optimal liquidity - essentially with their pants down.,
5448,yhpVAki47RI,Jio  net sucks,
5449,yhpVAki47RI,"I still think Jio brought a great revolution in the intranet service.  The place where I live in India , it is 60 kilometer away from Chennai.  I tried thru Airtel several times, but every occasion they were saying still the facility didn’t come to my place.  Whereas , a couple of years ago, I bought Jio wireless router and subscribe data plan 3 gb one day.  Which was phenomenal !  Whenever I come to India after  Jio,connection, i felt like I was connected to the world.  Also, it has been helping me to work from my native to US office during my travel in India.  All these happened by Jio.  Airtel might be good in other places, but not in my place.",
5450,yhpVAki47RI,"Although ,you are Bitching about the Most Genuine Player Jio ,we all should never forget that Airtel is looting us for packages like 1GB/299 and deducting 100s of talk time amount after data consumed of 1 GB.<br>Also, Money Control is  sponsor for this video. (Jis Thali mein khaya usi mein ched kar diya)",
5451,yhpVAki47RI,Thankful to JIO for breaking &quot;Market control&quot; of &quot;Airtel/Aircel/Vodafone/Idea/Docomo/Etc&quot;. 💯✅,
5452,yhpVAki47RI,Only bsnl provides broadband services in rural areas,
5453,yhpVAki47RI,I respect Airtel. But it is still 💩,
5454,yhpVAki47RI,AIRTEL my foot..... Worst and bad signal,
5455,yhpVAki47RI,I still don&#39;t know what aritel is doing nowadays LoL,
5456,yhpVAki47RI,But I&#39;m still using both Airtel &amp; jio LoL 😂,
5457,yhpVAki47RI,Jio net is 100 times better than Airtel in my area,
5458,yhpVAki47RI,Jio is still good than airtel.,
5459,yhpVAki47RI,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23savesoil"">#SaveSoil</a>",
5460,yhpVAki47RI,Are jio Ambani going to yemen or airtel England.,
5461,yhpVAki47RI,airtel dont have signal at all 🤮,
5462,yhpVAki47RI,"All networks in India  are worse, it&#39;s just that Airtel &amp; Jio are less worse than VI, which is a total worse 🤣",
5463,yhpVAki47RI,We love jio...no one can beat jio,
5464,yhpVAki47RI,Do sal use jio yes jio ko network issue and buffering net after that i am converted airtel till date no issue airtel is best,

5466,yhpVAki47RI,Big Thanks for airtel  becoz I&#39;m watching this video  ( 0 kbps ) 😡😡😡😡😡,
5467,yhpVAki47RI,Nice information 👍,
5468,yhpVAki47RI,I never got good coverage with Airtel,
5469,yhpVAki47RI,It&#39;s truly inspiring greatness. Keep it going with more knowledge add ons with current happenings,
5470,yhpVAki47RI,Vodafone is looteri company,
5471,yhpVAki47RI,Because jio tried to do monopoly. It&#39;s simcards do not operate in sim 2.,
5472,yhpVAki47RI,It is the responsibility of the people here to maintain a &quot;equally competitive company&quot; within the sector to ensure the quality of the other!!,
5473,yhpVAki47RI,Beating competition by providing worst network<br>Jio is still the leader<br>Bullshit airtel,
5474,yhpVAki47RI,Can you please start a series on different &quot;Industry Analysis&quot;,
5475,yhpVAki47RI,This is result of over analysing the situation and making a fool of yourself.<br><br>Jio is playing with market and do not want the blood strains on sleeve.,
5476,yhpVAki47RI,"Basically it is duopoly, ready to exploit !",
5477,yhpVAki47RI,JIO BROADBAND NO ISSUES.  AIRTEL friends find connection problems,
5478,yhpVAki47RI,Whatever joe might have done but still the network issues with Jio my god irritate so much airtel is still ok in terms of network but both are equally worse in my view always have so much issue with network and internet ☹️☹️,
5479,yhpVAki47RI,Abhi and neyu,
5480,yhpVAki47RI,"Great example!<br>This is the mistake Blackberry did<br>The moment they removed the exclusivity of BBM, they completely lost the war",
5481,yhpVAki47RI,"Pathetic network in BLR, I am Vodafone customer, beginning I just ported to jio postpaid. I made mistake. I&#39;m going back to Vodafone are Airtel!🙏",
5482,yhpVAki47RI,"The ecosystem has changed the whole perspective of business. As an IT employee I can also see several companies who are leveraging their ecosystems around the world.<br>Apple: iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iWatch, MacBook, Final Cut Pro, Siri etc.<br>Google: Google Workspace, Android, Google TV, Wear OS, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Assistant etc.<br>Microsoft: Office 365, Windows, Azure, MS Teams, Xbox, Power BI, MS SQL etc. Microsoft can easily create Windows for phones but that remains to be seen.<br>Adobe: Acrobat Reader, Photoshop, Lightroom, Premier etc.<br>Meta: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus.<br>Oracle: Java, Database, Cloud services etc.<br>Amazon: E-commerce, Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Kindle etc.<br>Disney: Marvel, Star Wars, Nat Geo, Disney, Hotstar, Disney+ etc.<br><br>Overall, you can only survive without an ecosystem if your product is better than the ecosystem product. Example: PlayStation, Spotify, Twitter, AWS etc.",
5483,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel pulled off a Jio,
5484,yhpVAki47RI,"Great Insights man. I learned a lot from the video. Though a lot us implicitly knew about the ecosystem created by Apple, but articulating it by breaking it down actually made it an actionable insight-entry level, Retainer &amp; upsells.",
5485,yhpVAki47RI,airtel charged 256 rs for 1GB . why will they go bankrupt?. they looted enough,
5486,yhpVAki47RI,content- 👍👍<br>background music - fed up ☹️☹️,
5487,yhpVAki47RI,i wish airtel would not have survived as well it has the worst network and poor costumer services just promising advertisement are gr8,
5488,yhpVAki47RI,I think i am choosing Airtel only because of its high speed that is the first and last reason and when jio lauch i choose it because of its less price even today jio has less price and Airtel has more speed but i choose idea because in my area it&#39;s speed is high and it is soo cheap and give free internet as well..😂😂,
5489,yhpVAki47RI,jIo destroyed others.that was gud.,
5490,yhpVAki47RI,"My first SIM was BSNL, then Vodafone ( Hutch) and then I switched to Airtel in 2010 and never switched! I never had to!",
5491,yhpVAki47RI,It&#39;s at the best interest of consumers to have all the 4 telecom players to be strong. Airtel &amp; Jio have been successful to have a good clout in the market<br>Despite huge debts &amp; AGR issue VI is continuing to provide service(which personally gave a pessimistic experience) <br>Government can resurrect BSNL to it&#39;s golden era of strength &amp; service standards by influx of Serious long-term investment(but i doubt it may happen),
5492,yhpVAki47RI,"So, the broadband actually saved the Airtel conglomerate",
5493,yhpVAki47RI,I don&#39;t think jio purposefully wants Airtel to stay in the market to avoid monopoly,
5494,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel didn&#39;t survive or beat Jio but got a kick up its back to get realistic in its price and quality thanks to Jio and simple economics of demand &amp; supply.,
5495,yhpVAki47RI,Kudos to you man 😅<br>Made an Airtel over Jio case study and got it sponsored by Moneycontrol (also owned by Reliance) 😂😂 This makes me love the Internet even more.<br>Such good content should never stop😃,
5496,yhpVAki47RI,"Let&#39;s learn together on Unacademy.

5498,yhpVAki47RI,Still the airtel ecosystem is very inferior and not user friendly compared to jio. Customer really struggles understanding the different schemes and the prices of airtel r too high compared to jio,
5499,yhpVAki47RI,Jio Jio Jio,
5500,fxjFr54LLOw,I love the pizza&#39;s from Domino&#39;s but it&#39;s to awkward that here in India they force the delivery partner to get the feedback instead of the management asking for the feedback,

5533,fxjFr54LLOw,You just got a new subscriber<br>Love from Nigeria ♥️,
5534,fxjFr54LLOw,Domino has changed the pizza quality in USA and improvised. Wonderful. Meanwhile in India the it’s still the old way. And 30 minutes or free always makes customers to buy. The pizza quality in India of dominos still sucks,
5535,fxjFr54LLOw,It&#39;s better to get learned then motivated,
5536,fxjFr54LLOw,I legit got a domino&#39;s ad between the video 😂,

5617,tI9fRLNmNkY,and where is Dell and where is IBM ?? IBM Rules...,
5618,tI9fRLNmNkY,Bhai tu hai kaun? When did you start all this? Start your business rather than youtube.,
5619,tI9fRLNmNkY,Dell already died 🤣😂😁,
5620,tI9fRLNmNkY,what is the use of joining the membership ? hey think school?? will I get quality notes or something??,
5621,tI9fRLNmNkY,He is the man who start to incorporate best hardware available in a computer. Otherwise people would have been buying all hardware from the same company. Like apple does it today. You can&#39;t use other company charger to charge apple iphone.,
5622,tI9fRLNmNkY,The book name is  &quot;Direct from Dell&quot;,
5623,tI9fRLNmNkY,very insightful.. good work,
5624,tI9fRLNmNkY,IBM yet in America.<br>Atom bomb.,
5625,tI9fRLNmNkY,Michael Dell surprisingly looks like Dannie Azoff of the wolf of wall street movie😂😂😁,
5626,tI9fRLNmNkY,I world love to see India&#39;s computer market growth story as well as I had my computer in 2004.The CRT display the mouse with a ball and a hard disk having capacity as low as 28 GB and RAM of 512 MB. Internet in 2012. It wiil really be exciting.,
5627,tI9fRLNmNkY,"PC market became commoditized and IBM sold the business to Lenovo back in 2005 &amp; Lenovo now leads the PC market. But it was not just Dell, it was Apple, Microsoft, and Dell along with some ordinary leadership in the &#39;80s that killed IBM. IBM reinvented itself (Several times since) but does not make consumer products anymore. Maybe they will once again when Quantum computers become mainstream.",
5628,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Why every video on YouTube has to say &quot;this killed that&quot;... Why can&#39;t you use some neutral words? Darn this clickbait stuff sucks, even if it gets more views, it sucks.",
5629,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Amazing content.👏👏👏<br><br>My free advise is to change the template of the video, as it was not made to watch at the first moment. It isn&#39;t got my focus.",
5630,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Don&#39;t use word kill, like a kid... It&#39;s looks bad. It will reduce impression on video. No one can kill anyone. May be just improved sales than a old company. How ever Dell is inspired by ibm. If no IBM there is no dell",
5631,tI9fRLNmNkY,Real life rocket singh,
5632,tI9fRLNmNkY,your voice irritates my ear... info acha tha,
5633,tI9fRLNmNkY,Don&#39;t compare Dell with IBM   <br>IBM is IBM  its more than 100years old company... those who know people still search for IBM laptops 😂 old is gold,
5634,tI9fRLNmNkY,Worth watching,
5635,tI9fRLNmNkY,dell sucks,
5636,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Love to see more of these, Proud and a Happy employee for 19 years and on..

5637,tI9fRLNmNkY,Thumbnail is misleading.,
5638,tI9fRLNmNkY,Michael Dell from Becoming Dell of America to Dell from China....🤨,
5639,tI9fRLNmNkY,Please make a video on Google.,
5640,tI9fRLNmNkY,You cannot keep such a threatening/ dubious  thunbnail,
5641,tI9fRLNmNkY,"And how the DELL fail ? like we are not see much divice like we have from HP, ASUS, ETC.",
5642,tI9fRLNmNkY,8 yrs of my Pentium chip dell laptop it has held up super strong,
5643,tI9fRLNmNkY,I know more about Computers than your Entire Species. So You can&#39;t Trick me.<br>Michael Dell is Some Canadian King. A PC Assembler. I could do that at age 13. Its like Lego.<br>It wasn&#39;t Dell that killed IBM.<br>It was your Father / God and those Borg / Avatar.<br>They Reverse engineered the X86 and Z80 CPU chip atomic silicon. Entire Galaxy working to Reverse engineer X86 and Z80.,
5644,tI9fRLNmNkY,"IBM was not killed by dell but by microsoft.  after inventing microchip, they were arrogant to thing that small will not grow big.",
5645,tI9fRLNmNkY,watching this video from my dell laptop😁😁😁😍😍,
5646,tI9fRLNmNkY,know what....m watching this video with a Dell Laptop 😆,
5647,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Sir, app video q nahi hindi m bante ho",
5648,tI9fRLNmNkY,"You will have to make a distinction between IBM and Dell where the former has professional accounts and Dell goes direct to customers. <br>Any business model where businesses deal with their customers directly are bound to succeed. Say cinema ticket. <br>What can be learnt from Dell is care for customers.  You never feel left out and brand recall is good. <br>That&#39;s why Amazon is doing well as it reaches home where family members recollect the experience. <br>For lessons,  to out against the best in the industry is tough as you need the support system. <br>In India any founder need the govt to support his enterprise.  How about US. <br>Next time cover the role of govt in the big companies establishment. Only then we can have a 360 degree idea about any business that succeeds in large scale.",
5649,tI9fRLNmNkY,Iam still on Dell lol and it still work and os is windows 7 and 500mb graphics card but 4gb ram and it is stilll lol ☠️☠️☠️☠️,
5650,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Dell might be an extraordinary company, but at present there products are below average and they start following the policy of quantity over quality and just keep on increasing prices of their low grade products.<br>Infact ASUS and HP are doing far better than dell in matter of quality.",
5651,tI9fRLNmNkY,Ur doing great work.. Love your videos!,
5652,tI9fRLNmNkY,Feels amazing listening to this while working for Dell itself &lt;3.,
5653,tI9fRLNmNkY,Make case study on Acer,
5654,tI9fRLNmNkY,But I&#39;m regretting after buying Dell laptop 2 months back. It broke due to hinge issue and customer service is the worst. I&#39;m never buying Dell products again.,
5655,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Whatever stated in the video may have been true in past, dell has become the devil today. I have experienced this (I own a dell laptop) &amp; linustechtips has also proved this.",
5656,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Now, you need to watch Company Man&#39;s &quot;The decline of Dell&quot; after this.",
5657,tI9fRLNmNkY,"And it today&#39;s date you would buy a Dell only if it was a laptop coz their desktops are crap. Yes, institutions would buy from Dell coz they are able to bulk supply but individual consumers won&#39;t, unless you want to score a gpu on a fair-ish price along with the system. And most businesses go with Lenovo for some reason.",
5658,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Thank you!<br>Wonderful content, really insightful!",

5669,tI9fRLNmNkY,"please make a case study on the declining market position of Dell,escpecially in B2C segment",
5670,tI9fRLNmNkY,This is too good ...so informative,

5677,tI9fRLNmNkY,"One thing about Dell is eventually they were able to undercut the builders (myself being one of them back in the days). I used to build much better custom systems for my customers at less cost but once Dell got the costs down to where it was no longer profitable to &#39;build them&#39;, I started buying Dell&#39;s for my customers (albeit inferior to the systems I had been building in the past). There was a hitch as those low cost Dells we&#39;re hardly upgradable and cut corners with some &#39;mickey mouse&#39; stuff which meant they had a reduced usable lifetime (aka: disposable computers). Not bad for my business but not good for customers as they tended to hold on to those systems way beyond that &#39;stunted&#39; useful lifetime.<br><br>Generally, I don&#39;t buy Dells for myself (personal systems). However, they were ahead of the game on supporting Linux on their server lines which made them the &#39;go to&#39; for servers running linux and Dell has good support for Linux. However, this is changing and this &#39;niche&#39; is eroding. Like IBM, Dell is a company I suspect is a fading &#39;giant&#39; and really Lenovo has the edge. IBM is remaking itself and Dell will have to do the same before it&#39;s too late. <br><br>Ironically, much of the &#39;on-site&#39; support in the 90&#39;s I got from Dell were outsourced to IBM service people. I suspect Dell will need to get off the x86 processor monopoly or their fate will be tied to failing to diversify and will be undercut by less expensive ARM and possibly RISC-V power efficient alternatives. Dell is too tied to MS Windows and even MS has embraced Linux as Azure is their &#39;cash cow&#39; now and lumbering into ARM and we&#39;re getting to the point that the Linux desktop for the masses it&#39;s mature and the Windows monopoly will become a problem for this hardware company. Note: Dell does sell Laptops with Linux preinstalled but on the high end.... despite Linux usually entering in the recycle end (aka: EOL systems where Windows can&#39;t be upgraded and still be a useable system). This is a problem as Dell&#39;s desktops often die after the first 4 years (aka: disposable systems) and use cost cutting &#39;junk parts&#39; that have no long time support. AKA: not good for small businesses or countries looking to &#39;move away&#39; from the MS monopoly and reduce costs without losing productivity.",
5678,tI9fRLNmNkY,Please do study case on Sony’s failure in Mobile and Laptop business,
5679,tI9fRLNmNkY,Actually same story I lern in 10th Std English Book,
5680,tI9fRLNmNkY,Where was apple II and  Macintosh in the picture. I THOUGHT APPLE was the innovation king everytime,
5681,tI9fRLNmNkY,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI9fRLNmNkY&amp;t=3m34s"">3:34</a> you mentioned Compaq made 100 million in first year but the text in video says 10 million",
5682,tI9fRLNmNkY,Avoid pop up ads Buddy as you already have sponsors. They are irritating,
5683,tI9fRLNmNkY,soon some will come and kill dell,

5687,tI9fRLNmNkY,Ganesh you really need to do a case study on plantir technologies which was founded by Peter thiel and I guarantee that you will be so surprised know,
5688,tI9fRLNmNkY,Sir ur all videos are very knowledgeable...and we are really like ur all videos.👍👍...is it possible to u to make this video in hindi language,
5689,tI9fRLNmNkY,make another entirely separate video or a part on AMD VS NVIDIA in GPU market and how AMD all alone   took fight with cpu market gaint Intel  and GPU market gaint Nvidia at the same time .,
5690,tI9fRLNmNkY,"very informative video as always . but do make a video on AMD VS INTEL in CPU market and how AMD rise dispite first gen Ryzen CPUs fail then came back with third gen Ryzen   CPUs and also talk about how they took a huge market share from Intel and became a value for money company and also explain their sales in 2019 ,2020 and 2021 briefly in CPU market .",
5691,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Reduce the watch time, or create shorts",
5692,tI9fRLNmNkY,"I think dell succeeded because of its early jump in the computer revolution!!!! And of course Michael Dell&#39;s intelligence, determination and leadership played a vital role in dell&#39;s success!!!❤ by the way great content! This channel is more than an MBA itself!",
5693,tI9fRLNmNkY,i don&#39;t know.hp sells more in india I think..,
5694,tI9fRLNmNkY,how does just in time system make the delivery faster. Is that that they employ more skilled professionals since they have capital saved from not opting for inventory?,
5695,tI9fRLNmNkY,"One correction,  the statement of IBM don&#39;t own is misleading. I studied IBM PCs and clones for a year, and It was IBM who brought architecture of segregating Memory (ram), processor and internal and external drives for memory and made the architecture Free for all as a service to computer industry.  <br>Also when companies had policy of take all profits by making all by themselves, IBM had strict policy like SAP and few other companies of partnerships and growing together. they chose this route deliberately to see world as we see today. the bus to connect hardware, 8bit and 16 bit memory address were all ibms design. IBM still own the design and architecture we use today and allowed all to use and compete with IBM without issue. <br><br>IBM was the one who invented computer in first place and without them none of these technologies even existed. Also, IBM designed personal computers and helped computer industry thrive...so saying IBM failed and Dell did better than IBM and hence Dell better than IBM  is completely misleading. Even today Dell uses IBM architecture and has not invented new architecture. IBM  helped industry thrive and clones such as Dell and hp and acer and all other companies make money and boast about it..",

5701,iQRe7OHtHXg,👌,
5702,iQRe7OHtHXg,Cv sreekanth(telugu CA) clearly said that NSE is fooling people since 2016,
5703,iQRe7OHtHXg,It&#39;s usually said &quot;Ask an athlete to know the importance of a second&quot;. This incidence may be put in place as to &quot;Ask a stock broker to know the importance of milliseconds&quot;.,

Ofcourse I can understand that you are not a stockmarket expert.<br><br>See it is not a railway reservation system where if you get the terminal before everyone else then you will get tickets.<br><br> In the stock market no one knows what happens next whether a stock goes up if you buy or goes down. So even if you are given 10 minutes exclusively before every body else there is no guarantee that you  are going to make profit when everybody else gets the terminal.",
5707,iQRe7OHtHXg,"You know I read about the co-location scam when the news broke. But the news always was about that, some dude got hired who didn&#39;t deserve it and that a himalayan baba was consulted.<br>This really gives credence to Jon Stewart&#39;s statement that the media is biased towards sensationalism and laziness and not towards educating the countries electorate.<br>Thank you Think School for rising above!<br>Love your videos.<br>If I could be so bold to suggest a case study.<br>How Jon Stewart a comedian, changed the media and news landscape in the US and became one the most trusted man in the States despite running a &quot;fake&quot; news show.",

First a technical one where no one could be blamed and second one  they got a &#39;culprit&#39;  . Clubbing these 2 together under one umbrella will be good for the reliability of the system :-P",

5756,iQRe7OHtHXg,great and good work thank you for your explanation in a simple way.,
5757,iQRe7OHtHXg,watched 7 videos straight non stop from this channel.,
5758,iQRe7OHtHXg,"So despite paying colocation charges there were some brokers who dint benefit from the service bcs the brokers who had logged into the servers first would receive information faster than those compared to the other brokers. So in all there were three types of brokers - brokers who paid co location charges and had first mover advantage, second are the brokers who paid co location charges but were logged in a lil late on the servers and the third are individual investors like us who had access to information the last . Is this understanding right ?",
5759,iQRe7OHtHXg,It&#39;s absurd that we do don&#39;t get to see this on tv where we pay monthly charges without hesitation and here we are seeing it for free and they have to get wait for sponsors to get paid,
5760,iQRe7OHtHXg,Co-Location to NSE server is a Crime and allowing such priority provision by SEBI is a criminal offence. If indian Government is not stopping this immediately it shows Governments inability or an indirect YES to the offence that&#39;s going on. regards,

5762,iQRe7OHtHXg,Awesome channel,
5763,iQRe7OHtHXg,"sorry to say This all is just Hyped!! Concerned about that lag with data? Even today, Try placing order over web through IBT based Discount Brokers and observe how much Lag you get. Thats what you should be concerned about more. Even today this Market orders comes with slippages but they are discounted while the model is being created Or the other hand Limit orders comes into play with almost negligible to 0 slippage if you want that level of precision (which again are sent to Exchange pre-hand so again incoming data lag doesn&#39;t matter). For Hedge Funds to reduce latency, they&#39;d be in Colocation already (Also that much slippages you mentioned in video are nothing as they itself buy in many Legs across various periods). Long short that lag practically made 0 impact from investors perspective as that level of precision in market Orders didn&#39;t mattered. Concerned people can be blamed for slower upgradation ;0)    p.s. I like you rest content :)",

5765,iQRe7OHtHXg,"Why still there is no action., Where the oppostion or real fighters",
5766,iQRe7OHtHXg,Thanks!<br>Many brokers buy shares for the clients at higher price (not 15 paise difference it was 3-5% of share price example reliance share price Rs. 2500 means Rs.75-125 and made loss of minimum 10% of total volume 1 crore the 10 lakhs shares approximately Rs.10 crores rupees per day for single share trade  now calculate the scam) and sold at lesser price on booking loss.,

5803,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Every Indian state has something unique and memorable to offer to tourists, but the Governments are not keen. Now Modi&#39;&#39;s Govt is targeting tourism to reach its 5T economy.",

5806,8tBuAM0XHmY,One single answer is false propaganda and they are good at counting a stranger as their father. This will appease a total stranger.  That&#39;s all.,
5807,8tBuAM0XHmY,i never agree if you say they spend money on roads,
5808,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Great video; as a mallu guy, I felt goosebumps, but still Kerala has a long way to go; starting right from the way they treat the foreigners...though significant changes are seen in peoples attitude, need to change atleast some peoples attittude;  then the next is hotel hygiene, waste management and much more......",

5811,8tBuAM0XHmY,"One of my favorite destinations for holidays in India. Great people and history and everyone on any budget can enjoy Kerala. The only thing to improve upon across India would be the safety and getting rid of tourist scammers. Having traveled to several countries, one of the reason Dubai and Singapore have so many more tourists is no tourist hounding and scams. Women tourists should feel safe and stop flirting with them. We need to get some basics right to boost tourism",

5815,8tBuAM0XHmY,I like the strategy: One tourist destination in every town of Kerala.  Trust me we can make it happen.<br>I also wish Kerala develops Kerala water transport just like mediaeval times we used to depend on boats for travel and most houses were built close to rivers .,

5841,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Don&#39;t thank current so called communist government in Kerala now for this, infact they were against modernization. Congress government started this... SGK is involved with the government now and hopes things with get better. Best way to describe communist party in kerala now is Mexican cartels.",
5842,8tBuAM0XHmY,God&#39;s own country but which God is the question,
5843,8tBuAM0XHmY,Good thing about kerala is its stuck in 1960s 1970s timeline. No industrial pollution. No mass transit development programs.  Everything nice and slow. All hard working malyalis overseas send their remittance home to family. Very idyllic way of life.,
5844,8tBuAM0XHmY,The tagline &#39;God&#39;s own country&#39; is surely overrated.,
5845,8tBuAM0XHmY,It&#39;s called inflation,
5846,8tBuAM0XHmY,Without sangh without bjp 😂,
5847,8tBuAM0XHmY,Proud malayali ❤️,
5848,8tBuAM0XHmY,"People are friendly and government developed a system to work, even the pilgrimage of tourists increased during the pandemic. Street food and street selling need to establish all areas as proposed to minister Riyas, an young dynamic minister from CPM.",
5849,8tBuAM0XHmY,Proud of our state Kerala.,
5850,8tBuAM0XHmY,But currently kerala state govt is struggling financially. The vision and dedication showed by the govt 20-25 years back was not taken over properly for sustainable development by the governments that followed. People are tax drained in every way possible. This will surely affect tourism here. Youth in kerala are leaving abroad. Soon kerala will be &quot;Olds own country&quot;.<br><br>- keralite.,
5851,8tBuAM0XHmY,"It’s not strategy. Kerala is just damn beautiful. I’ve been to many places in India in 1993 as a child, and Kerala just took the mantle for the most beautiful place in India.",
5852,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Very thought proactive. One factual correction. P V Narasimha Rao was the Prime Minister who opened up the economy. MMS was the finance minister then<br><br><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_India"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_India</a>",

5854,8tBuAM0XHmY,They dont have title as country in their state name so they add manually 🤣🤣🤣,
5855,8tBuAM0XHmY,I visited Chikmagalur last month and was appalled with the lack of civic sense among our Desi Tourists. Plastic and beer bottles dumped everywhere. There is a huge tourist inflow without much marketing by the inept state government. Responsible tourism can come only with government intervention.,
5856,8tBuAM0XHmY,Treat your citizens as customers.. That&#39;s a lesson to Governments..,
5857,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Commies own country,  dependent on foreign remittances.",
5858,8tBuAM0XHmY,"In what way kerala is a good state. I don&#39;t see any employment,  they don&#39;t welcome any non mallus,  but mallus go occupy job markets everywhere. Not ONE restaurant worth visiting , crappy food",
5859,8tBuAM0XHmY,I am a defence personnel from Kerala... Believe me u ll not get any such medical facility all over India like Kerala provides (starting from cleanliness to quality of medicines),
5860,8tBuAM0XHmY,Correction:- rice bags own country,
5861,8tBuAM0XHmY,Not mentioned about International Airports. There are 4 international airports in Kerala,
5862,8tBuAM0XHmY,China should also promote industry the same way,
5863,8tBuAM0XHmY,One thing I like to improve in Kerala is roadway. It takes 5-6hours to reach 150kms without traffic. Roads are good but most of them are 2 lanes only. If Kerala build high speed railways between important cities then it will be game changer,
5864,8tBuAM0XHmY,Shall I remind you something irrespective of culture/ religion... let the tourists wear what ever they want don&#39;t stare...  and keep smiling because they contribute more than your millionaires,
5865,8tBuAM0XHmY,"When youtube vlogging started trending, kerala government approached every main travel vloggers in the world, arranged free tickets and stay for them. I think this move was a perfect strategy and help a lot.",

5879,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Its a golden goose. But corruption, politics and unproffesionalism is killing Kerala tourism. I came across a friend who recently visited Wayanad, never in life he will visit again.",
5880,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Kerala truly deserves the title God&#39;s own Country. History, traditions, culture it has its own say in everything. Largest number of expatriates, global reach even from ancient times. Religious tolerance, level of education, health care 4 international airports in that small place.",
5881,8tBuAM0XHmY,Great video. They pulled a brilliant strategy.,
5882,8tBuAM0XHmY,Kerala deserves this title &#39;god&#39;s own country&#39; but i am wondering how tamilnadu making more money than Kerala in tourism as tourism is not in TN government&#39;s bucket list like Kerala!,
5883,8tBuAM0XHmY,*top 10 paradise of world &amp; not india,
5884,8tBuAM0XHmY,But Kerala Politics is so dirty<br>and kerala Eonomy is so dull<br>Cause today&#39;s politicians not concentrating on Tourism,

5890,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Part of the highlights of Kerala Tourism USP is captured in the video. The missing ones are higher literacy, local&#39;s accommodating hospitality, pluralistic culture, airline connectivity (04 international airports at an average interval of 200 km) etc. Tagline has to be realistic and the case of Kerala could largely go with destination realities. Increase in numbers could also be attributed to repeat visitation!",

5894,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Every state in India has the potential to grow as world tourism destinations. We have greenery in many states with good landscaping.<br>We have indigenous cultures, way of living, languages, cuisines, and most importantly, historical places and historical monuments those many of the countries in the world cannot claim to have and what else. Let governments have a vision and enthusiasm to promote tourism and we can make a good percentage of amount to contribute to our economic growth",
5895,8tBuAM0XHmY,"Actually all credit of Keralas tourism phenomenon should go to Mr.Amitabh Kant ,present Niti Ayog chief. He was an IAS officer in kerala then, and propelled Kerala as a tourist destination. Correct me if I am wrong.",

6006,dVtnSPZn6BU,Great,
6007,dVtnSPZn6BU,"As son of a successful LIC agent, I have heard many discussion between an agent with the client. And it is my strongest view that LIC has been successful simply because it was seen as a government (backed) organization. There was times in 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s where many investment companies would open up and siphon off people&#39;s money. Hence there was a trust on government backed LIC that helped agents to convince customers that their money was safe. I agree some of the other comments below that some lic branch officers were rude and behaved like any other government officer. But for common public, the safety of money was of utmost importance that helped LIC a lot.",

6021,dVtnSPZn6BU,"The real question to ask is &quot;Does LIC truly work in the best interest of policy holders?&quot; Whichever way I look at it, the answer is an overwhelming &quot;NO&quot;. Neither the products provide adequate cover, nor do they provide any meaningful returns. Yes, the policies work very well for the agents, who get a handsome commission - so this gives them massive incentives to mis-sell - and most victims are poor and the middle class. LIC (mis)uses the trust model of your agent (most of the time, it will be your uncle or someone close in the family) to erode people&#39;s money.",

6048,dVtnSPZn6BU,"You have to be careful about the pictures you project during your presentation, and please don’t be so loud.",
6049,dVtnSPZn6BU,Almost everyone employee of LIC undergo brainwash during their training. They suggest and promote only plans which will give you returns after decades. They don&#39;t inform customers about term-insurance/pure-risk plans. The worst part is these employees believe that pure-risk plans don&#39;t benifit customers.<br>LIC is a fraud company which makes buck loads of profit scamming the employees and customers.,
6050,dVtnSPZn6BU,"Agreed with everything but your point of good employee behaviour sounds vague because LIC employees also behave and talk rudely especially with rural people. Claim settlement duration is very poor in LIC as compared to its private counterparts like TATA AIA and Max Life where they settle claim within week, LIC often take months",

6059,dVtnSPZn6BU,Thank you for making such a quality content!,
6060,dVtnSPZn6BU,The other reason why lic is able to provide the claim money in time due to lic agents. Usually lic agents are from the same village or some random relative of the people. Causing easy enquiry and able to provide the provide amount easily directly tk beneficiaries.,

6065,dVtnSPZn6BU,loved lic but not customer because of affordability lic premiums are double than private companies,
6066,dVtnSPZn6BU,"Pls make a case study on some of the greatest PSUs in India like NTPC,IOCL,ONGC,POWERGRID etc...",
6067,dVtnSPZn6BU,that was actually a very bad step to acquire 245 private companies using law and force.  Thats why still very few percentage of people of india have insurance .,
6068,dVtnSPZn6BU,Thanks for the video. You&#39;re changing his we look at communicating for citizens who want to be more aware. Respect. 🙏,
6069,dVtnSPZn6BU,I must the LIC destroyed the meaning of Life Insurance because many have nightmare when policy get renewed or anything happens in between of premium payment time... In foreign countries people took an appointment of insurance officer to take an insurance... Now people don&#39;t have faith in the term insurance that&#39;s why they don&#39;t take it. I can confirm that in India 80% don&#39;t have insurance....,
6070,dVtnSPZn6BU,LIC is one of the most inefficient organization.. just check online premium and compare it with private players..LIC is a mechanism for government to milk any time..Most of the Failed OFS of PSUs were bailed by LIC...Mis selling is synonymous with LIC agents..sorry Ganesh not happy with glorifying such pathetic  organization,
6071,dVtnSPZn6BU,"Hi bro, please make a video about how to do a research like you do.",

6092,dVtnSPZn6BU,Super sir<br>Speak about post office rd scheme,
6093,dVtnSPZn6BU,They can have a zoom call with LIC agent in Covid times. Its completely wrong to think people would go on to websites and purchase insurance in matter of 5 minutes. Insurance is still a costly affair and personal relationship with a agent gives us that secure feeling from inside who has been operating as an agent in our hyperlocal region for decades and have built relationship with our neighbours. Trust is a big factor for LIC. TATA brand is built on Trust and we know how the business is doing.,

While those who don&#39;t think that way are surely not premium customers and they go for lower price commodity.<br><br>2. Well this one is for you... Well what you describe through these videos are marketing strategies which IKEA or any companies don&#39;t want to reveal.

6152,glHQPkrcf8A,small doubt <br>what about the product that is left as a decoy strategy. doesn&#39;t it pile up or is there any strategy to sell such products as well.,
6153,glHQPkrcf8A,"I have been following IKEA for over 2 decades and I have never found the &#39;decoy&#39; pricing methodology in practice in any part of the world. Also IKEA has been studying the Indian market for nearly a decade before committing itself to enter the Indian mkt. As an architect, we have learnt the hard way the decoy effect of proposing designs in a known gradation of quality. We deliberately show a bad/insufficient design along with a probable good design such the Client recognises shortfalls of the inadequate design and appreciates the fulfillment of the those deficiencies in the &#39;better&#39; design - where the entire thing is orchestrated.",

6168,glHQPkrcf8A,This looks like a scam. The website doesn&#39;t have any contact address. Only one link which makes you pay. Once you pay the money the system crashes and doesn&#39;t find a page. There is no communication from the website on the email address which they have gathered before taking your money. I want a full refund otherwise I&#39;m reporting you to the cyber cell.,

6185,glHQPkrcf8A,"I am sorry but the decoy pricing method that you share in this video (while the science of it makes sense and is applicable) is not a good explanation of why IKEA is so successful. <br><br>The absolutely main reason for their success is brilliant design for the price they charge. Period. <br><br>In addition to this, minimalistic design, creative functionality, retail store design, amazing packaging and outstanding DIY implementation also add to their success.<br><br>For a example, try and find - in India - a carpenter-made TV cabinet for the same design and price that IKEA will sell you. <br><br>It’s (almost) not possible. <br><br>Their sales are amazing because they get it right on so many levels (yes, including the cultural sensitivity of their target markets), not just pricing. Their retail store design is marketing genius. It makes you go through the store in a way that exponentially increases your chances to buy on a whim or impulse.<br><br>Form + function + reasonable prices. That’s why they sell truck loads of their products.",

6189,glHQPkrcf8A,Why you can&#39;t become to entrepreneur?,
6190,glHQPkrcf8A,To whomever reading this here is a little pun... If you see the laptop section in the description you can see that it directs to think pad since it&#39;s suggested by think school 😃😀😂 I know it&#39;s not that funny,
6191,glHQPkrcf8A,Why on earth would anyone want digital and print? This kind of nonsense works for American consumers who are not really smart. Indian users will go for digital coz it’s cheap and there is no point of print as well for the same thing. <br>The decoy effect is also used for Soda or coke. Small Medium and Large where medium doesn’t make sense and Large doesn’t look like it’s too expensive compared to small. But smart consumers either buy what they need or not buy at all. I personally don’t care for sugar drinks but will pick small if I have to coz most of them have free refills anyway.,
6192,glHQPkrcf8A,Online shopping made this strategy obsolete,
6193,glHQPkrcf8A,"Great pricing lesson, thanks!!!",
6194,glHQPkrcf8A,I don&#39;t know why this guys buy popcorn at movies which was just 10rs on road and we never ate it on roads,
6195,glHQPkrcf8A,Apple uses the same strategy in its product lineup,
6196,glHQPkrcf8A,Well illustrated and facilitated learning.,
6197,glHQPkrcf8A,But if no one buys the decoy product then isn&#39;t it a waste in terms of dead inventory and the cost involved in manufacturing? Can the margins obtained from selling just budget and premium products be so much that they compensate for the zero sale of decoys?,
6198,glHQPkrcf8A,"However kindly convey if there are two kinds of people who go for extremes of prices, why go for decoy anyway?",

6287,er752AxyziE,"Would like to add few more points on Bessemer.Though Bessemer Convertor(1856) was revolutionary for Steel Industry it had several cons. Some info on Bessemer Convertor :<br>📌Bessemer is one of the earliest form of steel making. There are two types of bessemer process :<br>1. Acid bessemer process<br>2. Basic bessemer process<br><br>🚀Acid / Basic represents the nature of refractory lining.<br>Acid bessemer process was the first to be found and later on basic bessemer process was found. Basic bessemer process is also known as Thomas process of steelmaking.<br><br>✅1.Acid bessemer process -<br>In steelmaking the impurities to be removed are C,Si, Mn and P.<br>Here C is a gas so no issues in its removal. Mn is also basic in nature so it is also removed without difficulty. But oxides of Si and P are acidic in nature , so they cannot be lowered in acid bessemer process. <br>The steel has high amount of Si, P and N after completion of process which is kinda bad. <br><br>✅2. Basic bessemer process :<br>Now since the lining is basic in nature Si, P can be lowered here unlike acid bessemer process. But still the problem of high N content in steel persists here due to usage of air as a oxidising agent.  Thus, Bessemer Process was later on replaced quickly and BOF became the go to SM process!<br><br>For more info feel free to check out the SM series here: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/metallurgy_daily/p/CR67KzPDpBq/?utm_medium=copy_link"">https://www.instagram.com/metallurgy_daily/p/CR67KzPDpBq/?utm_medium=copy_link</a>",

6298,er752AxyziE,Tata steel is great company? It has lot of debt,
6299,er752AxyziE,Really great business family that builds the nation and survived the crucial times.,
6300,urLoa8PkQpU,The interview is about how tanishq made into market....due to tanishq ...other jwellers are forced to keep karatmeter and 18carat jwellery....the story  now is different due to tanishq only,
6301,urLoa8PkQpU,Hi <br>I watch all your videos.<br>This one has really helped me in my business.,
6302,urLoa8PkQpU,TN government co founder of Tanishq as well?,
6303,urLoa8PkQpU,"Of course!! Quality checks by Tanishq, aimed to undermine its competitors can be fully trusted!!",
6304,urLoa8PkQpU,"In Chennai and Kerala Joy Alukkas, Kalyan and Atlas jewellers are popular",
6305,urLoa8PkQpU,can you please have case study on GIVA,
6306,urLoa8PkQpU,"jyada guru matt bann ,  <br>very very  high making charge  at taniasq  shope.<br>i provide all type   jewellery  at only 15% making charge , and gold  rate  carat wise.",
6307,urLoa8PkQpU,can we bake it too..?,
6308,urLoa8PkQpU,0.15sec the graph scaling is wrong. Please fix it.,
6309,urLoa8PkQpU,This is a superb piece of a documentary; for that alone I subscribed to your channel.,
6310,urLoa8PkQpU,"Mr ganesh nice presentation. The whole Gold business of india is controlling by  a small of city Kerala name as Thrissur.. <br><br>80 % of gold manufacturing of the country by Thrissur product. The well known Thottan Group of  thrissur making jewels for Tanishq.. <br><br>The well known jewel brands of india  like kalyan, joy alukkas, jos alukkas, josco are the product of thrissur. <br><br>I have a request to do a case study about Thrissur",
6311,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq is overrated,
6312,urLoa8PkQpU,Better buy from manufacturers directly which has very less making charges plus hallmark they distribute to these stylish showrooms who charge so much in making charges,
6313,urLoa8PkQpU,"In business, pragmatism wins the day?  🤔",
6314,urLoa8PkQpU,bro amazing case study <br>u have researched very deeply <br>this content should not be free <br>amazing,
6315,urLoa8PkQpU,&quot; The designs in India were mediocre &quot;. I think you slipped a little on this point. Indian jewelry and art designs r the most intricate in the world.,
6316,urLoa8PkQpU,"Poor vlogger !! Failed to research in Kerala ! 😂😂😂😂 check the Kerala brands - Kalyan , Bhima , Malabar , Jos allukkas !!! You will get contents for 5+ episodes !!",
6317,urLoa8PkQpU,Gotta feel sorry for those marwadis,
6318,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq doesn&#39;t not offer 1 month free investment from them in harvest schemes. This is verified today.,
6319,urLoa8PkQpU,"I think you lack bit of a knowledge, you did your research only on the brand but not the trusted players of the market, Tanishq is a brand that&#39;s been propelled by Tata.<br><br>I hope you are aware about the BIS mark and hallmark and various other certification. Tanishq is just a fad, will eventually die out and give in to the local players. May not happen overnight, will definitely happen.<br>Quick Tip: next time do your research from both ends. Easy to sit on a mic and blabber what you find on the internet, next time dig deeper and go beneath atleast 2-3 layers of the market.",
6320,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq is for upper middle class but they have recently started focusing on low ticket  customer for jewellery by buying caratlane for 300-400 crores (for middle and lower middle),
6321,urLoa8PkQpU,"Over decades Jewelers of India have successfully brainwashed Indians into believing that buying gold jewelry is an investment rather than an expense, and have successfully made fools of a vast majority of Indians. Tanishq is no different. If you want to invest in gold, buy stock in gold mining firms, gold coins and bricks. Buying jewelry is a sure way to make a loss. Jewelers profit when one buys or sells jewelry.  Don&#39;t trust any jeweler.",
6322,urLoa8PkQpU,That was great man.. it was insightful 👏👏,
6323,urLoa8PkQpU,"Being in the jewelry industry since1989, most of the points that you have mentioned are agreeable, But I don&#39;t agree that local seller looted their loyal customers. There might be a few scammers but not most as you have said. unfortunately, one rotten apple makes the whole bunch look bad.<br>But there&#39;s a new trend of scammers with Lab-Grown Diamonds, How they mislead cousotmers into believing that Lab-grown is somehow as valuable as Natural diamond by comparing both of them side by side, just to sell you Lab-grown. I think that needs to be pointed out in this diamond jewelry industry.",
6324,urLoa8PkQpU,"Saw this video on youtube incognito, and finally, I subscribed and commented, I appreciate the hardship that went into making this video and case study. My mind blown.",
6325,urLoa8PkQpU,"&quot; killed&quot; is a wrong word. You must not have done any regular dealings with the local jewelers. If you had, you will not have used that word. <br>They always have a tendency of cheating the customer one way or the other, while on the other hand Tanishq has absolutely fair dealing.<br>You can compare Tanishq with local jewelers in as many aspects you want. May it be Purity of the gold, carat value declared with that of actual value, workmanship, after sales service and many more. You&#39;ll find tanishq better. <br>So a customer who can buy so expensive items, would always go for the best.",
6326,urLoa8PkQpU,The cheating thing for gold in local jwellers is very very true trust me,
6327,urLoa8PkQpU,"I am grateful to Tanishq for introducing the concept of a caratmeter wherein the customers can have the purity of their gold checked and evaluated....yes they are a brand and their making charges are high, no doubt but till Tanishq came into existence all &#39;small&#39; jewellers simply took the customers for a ride.....this is my personal experience...",
6328,urLoa8PkQpU,"So called small jewellers dug their own grave to some extent. in the 90s it was common that they cheat. they fleeced my family by selling us 18k gold bangles saying it it is 22 and charged for that too. happened a lot in many circles with diamonds and gold. ppl find branded stuff ugly and expensive but they feel at least genuine hoga. unfortunately, overtime its clear that that too is not reliable.",
6329,urLoa8PkQpU,Absolutely Stupid conclusion. When and where did it kill small jewellers? Extremely over priced products. quality of diamonds is pathetic. It&#39;s the most useless and pathetic brand ever. What are you high on Think school?,
6330,urLoa8PkQpU,Please do a research on offline mobile shop economy,
6331,urLoa8PkQpU,"I bought a gold ring in Tanishq for 16k after 4 years the it turned into fake gold. So, the time will let you know what kind of gold you bought.",
6332,urLoa8PkQpU,LOVE YOUR VIDEO,
6333,urLoa8PkQpU,We all know how most jewellers in India earn so much money 🌚,
6334,urLoa8PkQpU,After the controversy on Diwali ad. I tried different brands and showrooms and surprisingly they have much better products with huge price difference. And now days every good jeweller gave you guaranty card of purity so trust issue is also resolved....,
6335,urLoa8PkQpU,"Not sure about quality. But making charges is very high. No idea whether others play with purity?  Any expert opinion please. 2 days back, wr visited The counter",
6336,urLoa8PkQpU,I think maker of this video has not visited Laxmi Road in Pune and Dadar Mumbai (or Sarafa in any other city).<br><br>Tanishq has hardly killed anyone. Just visit above mentioned places a week before Diwali,
6337,urLoa8PkQpU,Amazing content!,
6338,urLoa8PkQpU,"Boss u r outdated , Now they don’t provide 1 month discount.",
6339,urLoa8PkQpU,Being a tanishq super fan ..i always felt happy to buy from tanishq .it&#39;s a tata product and its worth it,
6340,urLoa8PkQpU,it is not a worth store for buying. you don&#39;t  get value for money.,
6341,urLoa8PkQpU,Smalll jwellers loot people may b they charge less but they fraud with amount of gold that they put in gold aftr using it for a while for months the gold colour start fading and look almost look lik brass,
6342,urLoa8PkQpU,TanishQ is indian company owned by TATA,
6343,urLoa8PkQpU,"Agree with Sindhuja, it did&#39;nt kill anyone. Even today traditional jewellers are doing well and their designs are improving. Think School team needs to conduct more  research on its topics.",
6344,urLoa8PkQpU,bro this guy is Very good analyst,
6345,urLoa8PkQpU,i visited that store once. everything was overpriced. title is a lie!,
6346,urLoa8PkQpU,Ad,
6347,urLoa8PkQpU,small jwellers are doing well tanishiq cannot make difference to them,
6348,urLoa8PkQpU,I think tanishq doesn&#39;t give 916 gold,
6349,urLoa8PkQpU,Wholesome content. Kudos to you.,
6350,urLoa8PkQpU,Only good showrooms normal design gold with a high making charges,
6351,urLoa8PkQpU,But Making Charges are high at tanishq compared to others,
6352,urLoa8PkQpU,I am from Karnataka. Tanishk is not famous,
6353,urLoa8PkQpU,"why all indian youtubers use foreigners to convey sonethung. for example here the youtuber us ss peajing abiut Indian oublic but showing a non Indian public at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urLoa8PkQpU&amp;t=8m42s"">8:42</a>",
6354,urLoa8PkQpU,Tab to MEESHO v kam nehi hai. . pura small business kharab kr k rakha hua hai,
6355,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq  making charge is very high.i never go to taneshq.,
6356,urLoa8PkQpU,Good job by Tanishq I hope they get you too,
6357,urLoa8PkQpU,I think<br>They in fact make people value local Jewellers more as they are way too overpriced and not up to the mark!! <br>This time not good research on your part!!!,
6358,urLoa8PkQpU,"Please visit Kerala Tanishq is nothing there.. Bhima, Kalyan, Malabar, Joy Alukkas, Josco etc are popular..",
6359,urLoa8PkQpU,Mainly through overpricing items. Collection is extremely unique no doubt.,
6360,urLoa8PkQpU,Try to make video within 10 minutes..,
6361,urLoa8PkQpU,"un understand able videos Sydney Australia <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>",
6362,urLoa8PkQpU,Well .. with Tata brand and Tanishq run like a corporate. At least when it comes to purity of Gold . Trust of gold is pivotal..I think that’s where Tanishq scores. Gold trust,
6363,urLoa8PkQpU,My mother visited tanisq but didn&#39;t buy anything instead bought from a local jeweler,
6364,urLoa8PkQpU,design to h hi nhi bakwas aur boring hai unnecessary show off hai bas,
6365,urLoa8PkQpU,"Most local jewellers sell gold coins of 99.95% purity. Tanishq sells 99.99 % purity coins. For that difference, they charge Rs 5000 extra",
6366,urLoa8PkQpU,Ground reality is something different. In my town it has been closed down,
6367,urLoa8PkQpU,"Small Indian jewellers are notorious for cheating customers ,there is no guarantee to the quality of gold they sell and they are not at all reliable . Tanishq did a huge favour to consumers",
6368,urLoa8PkQpU,Kyun sirf Tanishq hi reliance jo gali gali rashan de rahe h dmart bhi,
6369,urLoa8PkQpU,"Not at all Tata is still a underdog in jewellery business. The big players are kerala based jewellers like Kalyan ,Malabar, joy allukas ,josco and many more.",
6370,urLoa8PkQpU,Stupid video..it is local gold traders who get more business because of trust..big brands like this are good in advertisement and they get only upmarket clients who are not even 0.001% of population,
6371,urLoa8PkQpU,If you were Tanisqe jewellery you don&#39;t have to wear sarees pallu just show off everything if u wear Tanishq brand.<br>We Indian love other Indian jewelry. We hate deshdhrohi padukon.,
6372,urLoa8PkQpU,Never forget VARDMAN jwellers. Analysis is necessary and u are lacking in that,
6373,urLoa8PkQpU,described nicely,
6374,urLoa8PkQpU,My family still goes to family jewellers not these big corporations,
6375,urLoa8PkQpU,HI EVERYBODY...,
6376,urLoa8PkQpU,"No, it&#39;s not true",
6377,urLoa8PkQpU,"Ghanta!! Tanishq has 2 store near my house and I have never witnessed rush over there, other brands like Lalitha, GRT, Malabar are doing much much better then them.",
6378,urLoa8PkQpU,In Chennai local GRT brand that runs for now around 70 years is far more better than Titan,
6379,urLoa8PkQpU,Not a good decision to go for gold ornaments there ! Huge disappoint! Switched back to known local manufacturers,
6380,urLoa8PkQpU,"Really surprise to see this video. Tanishq has not even captured total 5% of jwelly market and it 95% is still owned by small jwellers, Get your fact corrected.",
6381,urLoa8PkQpU,I guess this video is a little too outdated as the gov itself has took very good steps like hallmarking to improvise trust in the local jeweler rather than brands. Bcoz branding is causing waisting peoples money which could indeed be used to buy more gold. Secondly daimond is not what indians want to buy you should do a little more research. And be careful something big will come in a year or two which will empower the local jewels more over these brands with a more market trust and very big competition for all such brands😁😁😁😁,
6382,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq didn’t kill anything😂😂😂 gold prices have decreased sale,
6383,urLoa8PkQpU,"Lol.. I am amazed you are not worried by entire economy being killed by two business houses! And if you will bother to check Tanishq prices, you will realise that not more than 1% Indian population can afford Tanishq products.",
6384,urLoa8PkQpU,Far Fetched.,
6385,urLoa8PkQpU,Local jewellers are far better in every expects.. the after sale service they only give us. If you purchase something from tanishq and after 1 month it got damaged then they will suggest you to exchange the product and pay making charges of the new product..<br> Isse chutiya banana nhi kahenge to kya kahenge.. vo us fact ko customer ko nhi samjhynge ki aap exchange karte hai to ek to purane wale saman ka making charges+ GST loss jayega aur new saman jo lenge usme fir se making charges aur GST lagega.. vo aisa gol gol samjhynge hame ki sir aapka koi deduction thori kia ja rha hai bas making charges lagenge aur exchange ho jayega....<br>  Wahin local jwellers bahut jyada damaged jwellery ko bhi repair karwa dete hai aur suggest karte hai ki jitna din aur pahan sakti hn pahan lijiye kuki nuksan to hona hi hai making charges ka abhi karo ya baad me...<br>Tanishq sirf kisi tarah meetha meetha bol kar lootna jaanta hai,
6386,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq kuch nahi kar raha local jewellery wale lootere hote hai Jyadatar.. dang se chek Karo to bilkul Sona nahi nikalta unki jewellery me..,
6387,urLoa8PkQpU,"Well BHIMA is still number 1 in kerala, i don&#39;t think thanishq is in top 3 or 5",
6388,urLoa8PkQpU,Tatika padukone,
6389,urLoa8PkQpU,Don&#39;t make false statements. Your analysis is wrong. Skilled working small jewelry shops are ever green and dependable. Bharath people will prefer small jewelry shops rather than corporate ones. So work out on a topic deeply and then make analysis...,
6390,urLoa8PkQpU,"In kerala atleast we have ton of brands like Kalyan, Bhima, Joy Alukkas, Malabar gold , Josco and many others. Tanishq will be the last in line if none of the above shops are open on a holiday😂😂. Their making charges are ridiculous.",
6391,urLoa8PkQpU,Seriously cause of that purity meter &amp; gold harvest scheme now I only buy gold from Tanishq brand...he pointed out the same thing...very well researched kudos to you &amp; your channel 😍❤️,
6392,urLoa8PkQpU,Buy a hallmarked jwellery from your local trusted jwellers...now a days it&#39;s not easy to cheat if you are aware of the norms..... Branded showrooms have v higher making charges and other charges...,
6393,urLoa8PkQpU,Khazana and lalitha is not charging wastage,
6394,urLoa8PkQpU,Their commercials are disappointing. They are trying to woo A small set of customer group ignoring large. Well it is just matter of few days to complete rejection. This business is much different than other tata brands. Stands out clearly for trying to be woke,
6395,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq not good,
6396,urLoa8PkQpU,Only on Purity Tanisq is assured compared to others. Others are saying 22  karat but purity is not maintained so.,
6397,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq is bad,
6398,urLoa8PkQpU,"you need a gold shop in every major town in jalgaon, maharastra because we have a ritual during marriage that we collect the gods (gold sheets with kul dev engraved on it) and polish them and then the Devatas participate in the marriage",
6399,urLoa8PkQpU,"Local owners used to cheat a lot, they will charge for 22k but when we went to tanishq and senco both said only 18k... So it&#39;s breach of trust",
6400,K7uvd1Muc80,"In this video, we cover the story of 2 College boys who decided to wage a war against the giants like Dominos and Mcdonald&#39;s! This is a story of 2 boys who built a 1225 cr business not by selling pizzas, not by selling burgers but by selling our very own favorite snack called the Momos! Watch the video till the end and tell us how you like it in the comments section.",
6401,K7uvd1Muc80,"can you please answer the following questions:<br>Question 1: What are the gaps/lacking that the entrepreneurs of “Wow MOMO” found among the other momo sellers, that helped them to distinguish their business?<br>Question 2: How “Wow Momo” established them as a reliable brand such that if anyone wanted to eat momo “Wow Momo” would stand out from the rest of the momo sellers?<br>Question 3: What are the important points to learn from “Wow Momo’s” success?",
6402,K7uvd1Muc80,But their portion size is too small if we compare it to the price they are selling.,

6416,K7uvd1Muc80,Feels like i need to start syabhale business in india. If peoples in india likes momo then i’m sure they would love to try this dish. As currently there are no syabhale competitors in the market.,
6417,K7uvd1Muc80,"momo is loaded with gluten , msg and oil - its just about taste , never call it healthy",

Either it be a thela in the street or the most expensive 5 star hotels and resorts, you will find momo in the menu book. <br><br>If that happens, wow momo will be nothing but a normal brand with decent business as people will have alternatives to choose good quality momo from varieties of restaurants. <br><br>Till that time, all the best wow momo.",
6459,K7uvd1Muc80,"I don&#39;t think momos can succeed in India as a regular meal or replace samosa for snacks. Most food brands in India don&#39;t maintain quality and hygiene. More than 50% of the time you get stomach pain and loose motion in all price category. When you complain or inform, they blame you and start misbehaving. Many restaurants staff are rude when you show cockroaches or hair found in their food. I have stopped buying outside food from corporate run restaurants.",
6460,K7uvd1Muc80,girl in thumbnail must have worked for you ..haha,

6469,K7uvd1Muc80,Watching this while having their signature Darjeeling Momos and Moburg 🤤,
6470,K7uvd1Muc80,"It&#39;s the hype i.e running Wow momos. Lack of players in this segment help them to get an edge..<br><br>Come to Kolkata, you can get far better momos at Rs.80-100. Even the quality of cheese at Wow momos isn&#39;t that great.. <br><br>The look and feel at the outlets may be another factor i.e driving their sales.",
6471,K7uvd1Muc80,"I live in the US. Starbucks, Taco Bell and wendys are too bad here and they are marketed as premium outlets there…",

6474,K7uvd1Muc80,"Your videos are very informative, think school 👌",
6475,K7uvd1Muc80,They are also very strategic in choosing the States in which they operate... No stores in NE states because of the obvious 🙃,
6476,K7uvd1Muc80,come northeast eat one of ours momo ghar special steamed pork momo... thats when you will know what real momo tastes like...,
6477,K7uvd1Muc80,Yes he is doing an excellent job,
6478,K7uvd1Muc80,You are uing the word healthier as if u r getting paid frm them.😀Maida is never healthy. You should use less and more unhealthy. Your channel is mostly consumed by the generation which is highly influenced by youtubers. Just a feedback. Love your content.,
6479,K7uvd1Muc80,Didn&#39;t knew Momo was this famous in India. But Kathmandu has the best Momos in the world and Buff Momo is the best.,
6480,K7uvd1Muc80,50 ka Momo 200pa🙂,
6481,K7uvd1Muc80,"Wow momo , tastes really bad … better buy it from local Tibetan or Nepali shop",
6482,K7uvd1Muc80,Oshin sitaula on the thumbnail.,
6483,K7uvd1Muc80,Where is oshin sitaula 🤔,
6484,K7uvd1Muc80,"If you have tasted Darjeeling momos, you won&#39;t like WoW momos at all. I do appreciate their packaging and presentation, but I do not find it palatable. Good information though.👍",

6488,K7uvd1Muc80,I don&#39;t know about franchise outlets but frozen ones are tasteless compared to prasuma,
6489,K7uvd1Muc80,"I come from a house where we used to make momos atleast once a week. Momos are not at all healthy, even the whole wrap ones. It’s a sin to call anything gluten as healthy. Plus wow momo uses monosodium glutamate which will hurt your gut like crazy. <br>Momo is just the tasty snack and wow momo made a chain. That’s why they are successful. I disagree with customer perception mapping",
6490,K7uvd1Muc80,The real taste of Momo is found only in Nepal. The soup and ingredients just hit different.,
6491,K7uvd1Muc80,Are you legitimately using the model&#39;s picture for your thumbnail?,
6492,K7uvd1Muc80,I don&#39;t understand much about business but the wow momo quality is next level.,

6552,lSF--3zgjKQ,I think he used fear for ditto in the same way. Fear of not getting the money after the mishap. But here it&#39;s a ethical marketing as long as ditto do what they say. Wonderful video.🙌,
6553,lSF--3zgjKQ,Byjus is doing exactly the same by fearing poor or middle class people to sell tablet,
6554,lSF--3zgjKQ,I hate it when Marketing guys get the credit when the real work is done by Advertising guys!,
6555,lSF--3zgjKQ,And teachers used it to make sales,

6605,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"They will rise and fall if they are into retail food and beverages. Business with lack of hospitality.<br>And currently that is what lacking in haldiram retail outlets.<br>Understaffed and lack of business process.<br>A customer has to go the counter to get a ticket for intended purchase items, then take the ticket to cash counter for payment and then come back to the same counter and show the receipt and wait for average 30min to buy a kilo of sweet.<br>More than happiness it brings frustration to consumers mind.<br>If only payment process is made easier and buy experience pleasure.<br>And above all I see only box and cartons of packed food when I step in shop.leaves me a memory of godown rather a sweet shop.",
6606,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Its not दंगर its महाराज डुंगर सिंह जी name …from there he took डुंगर,
6607,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Nice video but I&#39;m curious about the rumors of it being sold to another entrepreneur by the current generation...?!! 🤔,
6608,Z7P-t_yc8gE,The video is good…however there are some mistakes…<br>1. Bikaner bhujiya were never made by besan. They were always made moth daal.<br>2. The name of then king was Doongar singh. Doongar means mountain. Since the king was a huge man physically.,
6609,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"Very poor taste of titles for your videos. Sensationalizing, disrespecting and feeding fluff as content that doesn&#39;t substantiate the chosen title.",
6610,Z7P-t_yc8gE,I&#39;m a little confused here. Bro said he first gained trust of Marathi customers by selling them known dishes(like the South Indian food) and then moved towards selling unknown dishes like the sweet delicacies. But earlier in the video he said that he gained traction by selling kaju katli which was very new to his customers?,

6619,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"I doubt if Haldiram made 1 crore profit let alone 1,000 crores.",
6620,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Haldiram is a Snack Company and very few people buy and eat snacks and that too rich snacks.,
6621,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Great work bro! Thanks for sharing all these helpful videos!🙌🏼❤️,
6622,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Accurate Pronunciation of dungar is <b>डूंगर</b>,
6623,Z7P-t_yc8gE,5000 crore is not even a billion dollars how can u say billions <br>I should say crores,
6624,Z7P-t_yc8gE,It is pronounced as &quot; डूंगर &quot; in hindi !,
6625,Z7P-t_yc8gE,It is at least a 25000 crore company now,

6628,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Haldiram is having turnover in multiples of Rs 5000 crores. So your video is even more valuable,
6629,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Good reasearch and case study even for business leaders,
6630,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"False information, I remember going to Haldiram when I was a kid in year 1987-88 with my family at Chandni Chowk, and according to you in 1990 Haldiram was just 11 years old and working at a bhujia shop. So how can it possible that a big shop in prime location like Chandni Chowk named after that 11 years old?  Even on their website it mentioned 1937 as the founded year.",

6635,Z7P-t_yc8gE,U r really awesome... But if u go a lil slower it vll be best,
6636,Z7P-t_yc8gE,i think haldiram is still undervalued...compared to cureent date overvalued starups,
6637,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Haldiram&#39;s Kaju katli is too good ....🤗🤗,
6638,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Its Good that you are showing advertising and brand promotions only at the end of your content.<br>God bless you.,
6639,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Bengal to say.,
6640,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Thank you for this discussion,
6641,Z7P-t_yc8gE,It is always a case of a business venture once it crosses its boundaries the growth is self propelled...Brand name&#39;s popularity will do the trick...Like TATA Bata Amul Golgate.etc..Haldirams are addictive especially Bhujia ..so once consumed stay a consumer for life..In politics Modi is a brand ...Movies Rajinikanth... business tycoon Adani...,
6642,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"Haldiram despite selling pricy products uses Palm oil which comes from destroying rainforests in Malaysia. It also uses cotton seed oil which in turn is GM seed oil as 95% of the cotton grown in India is GM. Its packged products has quite good number of flavouring agents, colouring agents and chemicals many of which are carcinogenic and banned in EU. They also generate copious amount  of plastic waste. My two cents - buy local, package free or make it at home.",
6643,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Bro you are not right the journey you told was worng m employee at haldiram and it&#39;s not a true story if you dnt know then dnt naraate coz you are bit correct but not totally,

6691,Z7P-t_yc8gE,Haldiram&#39;s bhujiya has the potential to be the best Indian snack only if they reduce its spiciness! It&#39;s just too spicy and I can&#39;t eat it.,

One is Swami Vivekananda traveling to parliament of religions in Chicago via Japan, Canada and then to land in U.S. Another person is Jamshetji Tata, travelling to the west to study industrial sites. Swamiji comes to know of Jamshetji being onboard and meets him. After they get to know each other, Swamiji suggests to Jamshetji to start a company that is into research and development apart from the companies he already had. Swamiji says this research will help India in the long run. They soon reach their ports of departure. Years later in 1909, Jamshetji with help of Krishna Raja wadiyar , the then maharajah of Mysore establishes the Indian institute of science. Imagine how a sanyasi along with a great industrialist kick starts indian R&amp;D center.",

6900,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Thanks!,
6901,B_AY4a3_-GQ,RuPay is great so proud india has it but it still has lot of little issues while making payments very soon it will dominate visa and Mastercard infact its already almost there. i still prefer visa for the reliability and no glitches. i used Rupay for first time in india just few weeks ago and it was working well 95% of the time and the banks are also pushing Rupay cards and visa cards take you upto a month or more to receive if you apply for it from your bank which is a good initiative.  India is going to dominate the world in a few years.,
6902,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Very informative.,
6903,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"When i started watching this video I too was mesmerize as this being a masterstroke until <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_AY4a3_-GQ&amp;t=10m18s"">10:18</a> my perception changed, The gov want to take control of the unorganized sector and hence giving rewadi we all know what this gov did to the LPG cylinder and petrol/diesel. The purpose is to start taxing the unorganised sector later this is the sole mindset. India has been able to bounce back from most recession because of this unorganized sector as it remained uncontrolled and there was no burden on these ppl towards loan repayment, cars, buy luxury items etc. What the Rupay card will do is push them into debit in the long run while the gov will keep collecting tax. No doubt we do need a rival to Visa/Mastercard but all are evil. While Visa/Mastercard collect revenue from foreigners, Rupay is building castles ripping its own ppl how fair is that.",
6904,B_AY4a3_-GQ,A very visionary step by the great Manmohan singhji... this is what happens when a learned fellow is at the helm.,
6905,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Can we get rupay cards from banks like icici and HDFC,
6906,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Let&#39;s convert our visa debit credit cards to Rupay.. let&#39;s contribute in nations growth 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 i love my India,
6907,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"Wait!!...😧 375 million transactions get , out to be #1 payment network in India –with a population over 1.3b??... That&#39;s disappointing!! And here in lays the difference between China and India.   China maybe clocks 375m transactions in a month, let alone a year.  ... India needs to catch up. They were already late. Chinese internal payment network was established in 2002.",
6908,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"Watching YouTube videos, I have taken a PNB Rupay Credit Card &amp; attached with my BHIM account. Finally, I found out UPI+Credit Card payment is not accepted at any regular shops. Where it is accepted (big retailers), they already accept normal Credit Cards with reward-point benefits. It is an absolutely useless thing.",
6909,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Superb .Very well explained. Useful.,
6910,B_AY4a3_-GQ,If this was congress they would have made a facility such that only American companies can provide cards to indian and make the american company donate to CONGRESS PARTY funds and the khan family will enrich themselves. On the other hand Modi goverment has done wonders for indian people.,

6912,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"amazing explanation , cleared all of my doubts . just brilliant",
6913,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"Idk what’s more extraordinary, the ability of this govt to make India self reliant, or the inability of the previous govt for having such self destructing western serving policies and politics.",
6914,B_AY4a3_-GQ,brilliant analysis bro.,
6915,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"Very well explained... More I&#39;m watching your videos, more I like your unbiased crystal clear analysis",
6916,B_AY4a3_-GQ,The process seems to be slightly incorrect. The card network sends back the approved or rejected code to the acquiring bank and not to the payment gateway.,
6917,B_AY4a3_-GQ,I like Govt doing good things but killing private business is bad.  We all know how govt services work in India.,
6918,B_AY4a3_-GQ,All credits goes to Prime minister Modi,

6929,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"The problem and risk can be reduced by putting a limit - say - Up to Rs. 500 (or Rs. 1,000) there is no transaction fee. Any additional amount spend will have a fee of 1% of the over and above amount.<br>For a Rs. 2,000 purchase, fee is changed for Rs. 1,000<br><br>If this policy is interdicted, there will be huge profit generated and that profit can be used to help the poor!!",

6939,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Now Pak govt is copying Rupay but without UPI system.,

6945,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Rupay is useless however UPI is great.,
6946,B_AY4a3_-GQ,That&#39;s the use of Rupay card? It&#39;s not international and only works in India. <br>Visa and Mastercard are international and it works in any websites.,
6947,B_AY4a3_-GQ,That&#39;s why Modi said he will share 15 lakhs rupees to each Indians... so that new bank accounts can open,
6948,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Kudos to the Indian govt. for this initiative. At times like this we all have seen the importance of self reliance. I just hope that all necessary measures are taken to fill up the lackings and this initiative succeeds because then India will gain a big upper hand in the financial sector of the world.,
6949,B_AY4a3_-GQ,public sector banks like the SBI are not promoting GOI interests or national interests,

6963,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Only the govt. Banks give rupay cards. Even SBI with their premium accounts give visa cards.And that makes us feel that Rupay is a cheap card.,
6964,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"The problem with rupay is apps like Spotify, Netflix don&#39;t accept it. And Private banks like kotak, ICICI, HDFC etc don&#39;t give a rupay card with their premium accounts. That hurts the brand value of rupay",

But, i returned it and asked them to give me Rupay card as previously mine was a Rupay card only. So the govt should tell all banks to give only Rupay cards .",
6969,B_AY4a3_-GQ,As you said in the last I don&#39;t think this will work out with 0% MDR for long term.. It will defeanetly make the bank and government into losses.,

6979,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Netflix is backing Visa &amp; MasterCards because they are Americans against Rupay cards 😢,
6980,B_AY4a3_-GQ,That&#39;s why Indian media sucks! It&#39;s been 8 years and this is the first time I&#39;m hearing about it.,

6986,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Had goosebumps from amazement and pride. Vande Mataram.,
6987,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"You totally missed the point of visa and master card.  These cards are primarily credit cards and make their money through 20% interest on short term loans. Debit cards are a tiny portion of their business.  Rupay has no credit facility to encourage short term loans.  Since rupay is now free all the Indian suppliers are being squeezed out, with Paytm barely surviving, while large us conglomerates like Phone Pe (walmart), Amazon pay, Google pay etc grabbing a bigger percentage of the transactions.  Without a financial incentive nobody can develop these services.  Indian banks have totally ignored app based payments and barely add it to their bank app",
6988,B_AY4a3_-GQ,It’s definitely a well thought out and structured approach to financial inclusion and independence. And the model will be sustainable at nominal mdr rates with scale and higher penetration of small ticket short term loans to merchants. With both UPI and Rupay going international these rail roads will also bring in much needed FX income to India while ensuring our data localization.,

6995,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"Surely after a time the numbers in investment will go up. So, i think that the people at low sector should get a bank account for 0% charges but people who could earn around 40-50k per month can be charged with regular percentage and also a income tax check on people can help the government to know about the money generated and are there people who don&#39;t pay them correctly..!",
6996,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Hat kuch bhi visa card is now used rupay is only in India,
6997,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Very nicely explained. Thank you. Do note though that RuPay was launched in 2012 so it was before the JanDhan bank accounts.,
6998,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"Rupay was introduced in 2012, not during Modiji&#39;s regime. Hence a photo of Modiji on the thumbnail seems misguided of the original credit.",

7014,TCboTQr8Ecg,Yea right..still think they are better than Amazon ? 😀,
7015,TCboTQr8Ecg,"purplle is a company with same facilities and came before nykaa, why did it fail?",
7016,TCboTQr8Ecg,PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO ON TATA ELXSI,
7017,TCboTQr8Ecg,Can someone explain how a inventory led model is superior to a marketplace? If someone’s starts a business like this where do you get the capital to invest in soo much stock? What happens if the stock does not sell through?,
7018,TCboTQr8Ecg,Just want to know how nykaa on the first place had a Money to buy such expensive makeup in bulk initially???,
7019,TCboTQr8Ecg,thanks brother for great guidance 🙏🏻 May God be with you and your team and families always 🙏🏻,
7020,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa is just another fraudster company that&#39;s all. On top of that they charge more money on products which can be bought at cheaper rate at other online store or on shops.,
7021,TCboTQr8Ecg,More profit more tax,
7022,TCboTQr8Ecg,Bcoz the founder is an MBA in finance and a ca so focus was always on finance and profitability,
7023,TCboTQr8Ecg,Flipkart also an indian company so why they can&#39;t use inventory model,
7024,TCboTQr8Ecg,Flipkart is not indian company...WTF🤔🤔,
7025,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Just wanted to say in inventory model the e-commerce portal bleed like anything in terms of margins,  where they make a very little of profit compared to Marketplace model as the due to liability of Inventory and outright payments. Market place model is where they make the money, as the portal is just the platform to sell, without any stock liability and just charge of commission on the consumer sales.",

7040,TCboTQr8Ecg,Please make a case study on fabindia,
7041,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nyka sells original that&#39;s why it buys directly from brands.,
7042,TCboTQr8Ecg,My doubt is...so why cant Amazon India or Flipkart India both register subsidiaries or a cloud tail a vendor owned by Amazon but can be owned by an Indian do what Nykaa is doing?,
7043,TCboTQr8Ecg,Please use more video clips using Desi videos.,
7044,TCboTQr8Ecg,Every time I watched his video I get the ad of the company in which he is making video on. Like nyka ad in this video,
7045,TCboTQr8Ecg,Can you pls do let know why Myntra is better or popular than Nykaa fashion dealing in clothes n accessories,
7046,TCboTQr8Ecg,Damn good,
7047,TCboTQr8Ecg,Like you mentioned the inventory model can&#39;t be carried out by foreign players so amazon can&#39;t do but what about flipkart ?,
7048,TCboTQr8Ecg,I like your simple xplanations man. Keep it up,
7049,TCboTQr8Ecg,Make video on hyperlocal marketplace and whats gone wrong with local baniya amd paper tape and how to solve that.,
7050,TCboTQr8Ecg,Dude please get your facts right.,
7051,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Nykaa USP which I feel as a buyer: better transperancy of brands, better transperancy of products (it shows all shades of foundation for example, so you know which shades will suit you: it allows to see how foundation will look on different skin colour with a picture), clear instruction on how to use the product, expiry dates and ingredients also. And last but not the least, their packaging is top class, it makes the buyers feel that Nykaa has made sure that products reach with minimal or no damage. It gives a sense of value, care which the customers have placed on the products.",
7052,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa has been reported of selling counterfeit impoted products and also withdrawing delivery services from several previously deliverable locations. Still people continue to shop at nykaa because of the perception that it has a higher standard to competing e-commerce retailers,
7053,TCboTQr8Ecg,please make a video on  Amaraja battery also On Bitcoin Crypto  risk rating and usage,
7054,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Just wanted to add a few points here and there, the horrible in-store Nykaa experience is a real thing. Sephora hires way more experienced people; Nykaa, especially in tier 2 and 3 cities, lacks on that aspect. And that remains a market to be tapped. However, one thing that worked with Nykaa&#39;s own ranges has been its community and their intensive market research. The shade range that they offer is exceptional for brown skin-tones. Brands like MAC which operate across the world and cater to all skin shades are pricier, and in the section that is experimenting with, or exploring makeup, a good below 500 product is amazing. <br>Oh and they have an entire section of website only for makeup artists, specific offers and product ranges.",
7055,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nyka is the Sephora of India,
7056,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nyka also sends duplicate products. And also half empty ones,
7057,TCboTQr8Ecg,"I&#39;m watching this video, after watching nykaa ad🔥",
7058,TCboTQr8Ecg,Beauty products themself are nonsense products. Day by day people will stop using these products.,
7059,TCboTQr8Ecg,I think soon nyaka will be swallowed by Amazon or flipkart. No unique value except inventory model. Fake products and customer awareness soon will be addressed by Amazon.,
7060,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa packing is good...,
7061,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Exactly I am actually purchase books from Amazon (they have good collection but recently delivery charges getting high )<br>For Dress and shoe , bags I trust Myntra and flipkart most <br>And for makeup Naayka always .",

7066,TCboTQr8Ecg,I love nykaa stores. They leave their products open and let the customer choose and check those by their own. It&#39;s very much comfortable. We get to choose what we want without having the seller pressure. And that&#39;s how we ended up buying what i really want not what the seller want us to buy.,
7067,TCboTQr8Ecg,@think school tell me what product have you bought from nykaa and what did you like the most in the product?,

7076,TCboTQr8Ecg,Superb!!!,
7077,TCboTQr8Ecg,But nykaa is not profitable!  It held back its marketing expenses of the previous quarter instead of showing it as cost. This automatically showed its balance sheet as healthy. It was  a simple case of window dressing.,
7078,TCboTQr8Ecg,This is how advertising the full video about nykaa and other apps😂😂and telling about knowledge. Bhai tu toh lottery maar di🤣🤑,

7091,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Bro Nykaa sells products that occupy less volume so revenue unit of space used is high &amp; inventory cost very low  which means they need less space to hold high value articles , on contrary AZ &amp; FK deals with multiple sort of product with different warehouse space <a href=""http://requirements.so/"">requirements.so</a> inventory holding &amp; carrying cost and other expenses increase significantly so they use hybrid model , but Nykaa solely uses inventory led models",

7106,H3Z7bFXfMAU,humans without considering their ethnicity and religion have right to live if Indian people can feel the pain and segregation against Tamil people in Sri lank which i also do.

7110,H3Z7bFXfMAU,China did not trap Srilanka to a financial ruin. The decision was ultimately their&#39;s to accept or simply decline. China merely abused their situation for its own gain but who wouldn&#39;t in this geopolitical race. Criticizing the international community and world leaders who didn&#39;t want to take the lead or be brave enough to call out this situation would be more interesting.,
7111,H3Z7bFXfMAU,This is what happen when an incompetent n corrupted leader who prioritize his wealth first.,

7114,H3Z7bFXfMAU,China is not smart but criminal. They doomed Pak &amp; Srlanka Why? They have a master plan thro Pok enter India &amp; capture J&amp;K. Then Srilanka dooming is also another way to get a closer approach thro Srilanka into India. That&#39;s why Mr.Modiji setup an army base on Andhaman Nicobar islands to keep a watch on China &amp; prevent them entering the island. Brainy analysis by the young boy of KUKU FM. 👍.

7127,H3Z7bFXfMAU,"I know Indians use the tragedy Sri Lankan people go through for their own political advantages. But this video has surpassed every propaganda material I have seen. <br>China did not destroy SL economy. It was the loans taken from western creditors or the international sovereign bonds that lead to SL economic crisis. <br>And SL ethnic crisis is a spill over of the Dravidian ideology, the state ideology of Tamil Nadu. The Dravidian ideology is the South Asian version of Nazism. Just like Hitler&#39;s obsession with Aryanism gave birth to Nazi Germany, Tamil supremacist&#39;s obsession with a mythological Dravidian history gave birth to Tamil nationalist ideology, which has wreaked Sri Lanka. <br>Both Singapore and Malaysia could control this superracist ideology while SL could not and that destroyed SL. <br>The Sinhalese people the natives of Sri Lanka were victimized by a Nazi like Supermacist ideology coming from TN which gave birth to a similar Tamil ultra nationalist movement within Sri Lanka.",

7129,H3Z7bFXfMAU,"I agreed everything except that  LTTE part. Thay didn&#39;t care about tamil pepole. Sri lanaka went against British decision in war so, british blame sri lanaka for genocide. British the reason for most of this.<br>It&#39;s like pakistan and india.",
7130,H3Z7bFXfMAU,"Appreciates your time in research and analysis bringing the in details of subjective caused the current situation in Sri lanka. But the first 4 minutes spent painting white on a group who was a drawback for 27 years in Sri lanka is totally not good. I think you would do better if you dig deep in that part and edit the video. violence and non-violence are 2 sides of war and some clauses you speak in your video seems you trying to bring a bad picture on one side and others are good where i disagree. But overall the video briefs well the situation in sri lanka and corruption government entities. i am a sri lankan going through your videos and already subscribed. hope you understand my point well, if you read till end.",
7131,H3Z7bFXfMAU,Srilanka had to deport tamils because most of them were forced to migrate to srilanka by british to work in srilankan tea estates beacuse sinhalese refused to work as slaves to british.And at the time indian tamils accounted for more than 10% of population in srilanka without any basic needs in the estates.,
7132,H3Z7bFXfMAU,"You forgot to say that india is a reason why srilanka completely lost 26 of its valuable years of development due to the war.Because india trained and weaponized LTTE back in 80&#39;s thats how they became powerful enough to fight against a trained <a href=""http://army.now/"">army.Now</a> indians talk about those 4 billion dollars in credit line to srilanka then what about the 200 billion dollars they lost because of war?<br>But last i d like to say that we can forgive but not forget.srilanka thanks india for the helping hand they given recently and now we have to work together to elevate  south asian region from poverty and become powerful with greater coorperation and professionalism.",

7140,H3Z7bFXfMAU,I dont agree with you regarding that sinhalese were torturing n discriminating Tamis. Sinhalese are normally soft natured n calm people. Yes its true that Mr SWRDB had brought a sinhala as state language. But Tamils or Muslims were never treated as 2nd citizens. Everybody had/ has the same rights. Actually minorities are better looked after than the majority sinhala buddhists nowadays. <br>Chinese trap is right. I dont know why you  ever wanted an un necessary sinhala- tamil issue here at all.,
7141,H3Z7bFXfMAU,This is becoming my fav channel. I want to know &quot;what the hell does china get out of all of this? &quot;,
7142,H3Z7bFXfMAU,"This is a typical Hindutva piece of propaganda. Never ever expect an orthodox Hindu to be able to represent the truth. The truth is that even the Tamils that were approved for citizenship are descendants of the very powerful south Indian empires that continuously led violent invasions into Sri Lanka for centuries. Each time as they invaded their first action was to impose Hinduism and the abominable caste system, and each time small Sinhalese armies managed to defeat them at the end and reclaim their country back. Whatever so called discrimination the Tamils have experienced within the last two centuries is due to the fact that they later cited with every European invading force so that they could rule over the Sinhalese. For example, when the British came the Tamils were favored as a tactic that the British always used. The British would always use a minority to rule a majority and in this case it was the Tamils and a new class of Christian they had also created. The British gave a lot of power to the Tamils which they used in turn to vent their hatred against the Sinhalese. These things were never mentioned by this ultraorthodox Hindu host. Last but not least, despite all these economic problems the average income and quality of life of the Sri Lankan people have always been higher than that of Indians. This was even reluctantly mentioned by a few Indian hosts in other programs. Also, discrimination has always been lower in Sri Lanka due to the fact that Buddhists do not put people in water-tight compartments called castes. Women have always enjoyed more rights and there was never widow burning among the Sinhalese. Every abominable cultural practice that came from India was confronted despite overwhelming odds. The Tamils have a lot of fantastic claims that even the British denied as factual. Ultimately, it is not the fault of Tamils either and that is because the Brahmins control their minds and religion. It is because of them that Hindu shastras consider Buddhist as polluting by touch and culture. Hindu scriptures such as many puranas clearly forbid Hindus to have contact with Buddhists or those who follow a different path. The Sinhalese have never considered Hindus as impure or ill omen despite all their violence. Remember, Hinduism is the only religion that treats a fourth of their own supposed followers as untouchable. It is the only religion that kills members of their own religion on a daily basis for being impure. Now, if they treat their own people like that you can only understand the cruelty that was forced upon the Sinhalese each time they invaded centuries ago. Still though, I have no hatred towards Tamils because I know for a fact that the majority of them are good people and I wish them a happy future and success in life. Best wishes and may the Sri Lankan people succeed in creating a better future than the one that was forced on them by a group of criminal internationals.",

7148,H3Z7bFXfMAU,"How can you say China <i>secretly</i> killed Sri Lanka? The Lankan politicians knew fully well what they signed up for when they accepted the Chinese loans, it was there in the contract. There was no objection from the people either when their leaders accepted the loan and started construction of their white elephant projects.<br>I agree, China has been cunning in trying to entrap poor nations thru debts. But this entrapment is not some fine print in the contract, the terms of the deal is in the open and there for everyone to see! If the Sri Lankan leaders still accepted Chinese &quot;help&quot; after reading the terms, then they did so willingly, nobody arm twisted them into it, not even China. It&#39;s unfair to blame China solely for Sri Lanka&#39;s act of volition.",

7175,H3Z7bFXfMAU,"If someone tells you that China is engaging in debt diplomacy or that China is enslaving the developing world with the so-called debt trap, don’t let them fool you. For instance, they may claim China is the biggest lender to Sri Lanka but the truth is western lenders are the biggest lenders, whose aggregate debt is over 4x of that of China.<br><br>Here are the key facts to consider when analyzing the current debt crisis in Sri Lanka, and for that matter, similar events in developing countries in general.<br><br>Q1 - Is China the biggest lender to Sri Lanka. Answer - no, 47% of its foreign debts are in form of Eurobonds and many of these are Western Institutional Investors such as UBS, JP Morgan, Blackrock, etc. Outside of this category, ADB is the single largest lender at 13%, followed by China and Japan, each at 10% apiece, and then World Bank at 9%. In other words, saying China is exploiting Sri Lanka through a ‘debt trap’ is completely false, or misleading at best. <br><br>Q2 - Is China causing the debt crisis in Sri Lanka or is it helping to address such debt crisis. Perhaps we can use the Hambantota Port to illustrate this as it is often cited as the exemplary debt trap case or China involved in predatory lending. Sri Lanka’s bloating foreign debt problem already appeared in the 2010s. In 2017, China (through Export &amp; Import Bank of China, China Development Bank) was called in to refinance its previous debts to Sri Lanka as well as facilitate the latter in servicing other foreign debt payments. A JV between Sri Lanka’s state-owned Port Authority and China Merchant Bank was formed in 2017 to run the said 99-year lease of Hambantota Port requiring China’s side to provide new USD900 million funds. Without which (ie the emergency funding), the country would have faced serious debt distress. In other words, this port-lease / emergency fund was not causing the country’s debt issue, but rather alleviating it.<br><br>Q3 - When these developing countries can’t keep up the debt payments, what would China normally do? As a matter of fact, China has assisted these countries by debt cancellation and debt restructuring (including reliefs such as extending maturity, interest rate reductions, refinancing, and extensions). Beneficiary countries include African countries as well as countries covered by the Belt and Road Initiative (see D. Brautigam’s clip for details).<br><br>Q4 - Where did the borrowed money go? Let&#39;s again use the Sri Lanka case. The foreign debt is being spent on infrastructures - in this case, Hambantota Port. As with all infrastructure investments, such spending enhances the future productivity and living standards of its nationals. Meantime, such spending also aids domestic employment. Most importantly, the money trails can be easily tracked and traced (for instance, railways or power plants). On the contrary, funds provided by the Eurobond Market have been mostly applied to cover the country&#39;s trade deficit and to meet fiscal deficits. In some developing countries where corruptions are prevalent, some of these funds may be misappropriated, ending in the pockets of its political leaders and oligarchs.<br><br>Q5 - What is the impact of rising international interest rates on Sri Lanka’s foreign debt? Interest rates hiking means that the refinancing costs of Sri Lanka&#39;s foreign debts will be on the rise, making its dire financial situation even worse. Worse still, Sri Lanka is importing inflation as its currency devaluates (on the contrary, USD appreciates with rising interest rates). Foreign goods, as well as commodities like oil and gas, are made more expensive, resulting in acute food and energy shortages.<br><br>In conclusion, the debt trap is not caused by China, but rather by western lenders. They are making it worse for Sri Lanka as these Western Countries are raising interest rates, making it more difficult for the country to service its interest payments and refinance maturing debts.<br><br>Deborah Brautigam, a well-known scholar, has covered China ’s ‘debt trap’ myth extensively. She specifically addressed the Sri Lanka case in her clip (see the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Z7bFXfMAU&amp;t=15m20s"">15:20</a> mark onward). <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5SvFjlu9ZM"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5SvFjlu9ZM</a>",

7390,WCJQ2PhzEOM,"A small but close-to-life example. Covid badly impacted many including Vegetable vendors too, as neither could they come to societies nor people were willing to step out. One of the Vegetable vendor near our home started Home-delivery (This may be common in urban areas but wasn&#39;t in our location). And within months, he became the only vegetable vendor our entire area had. <br><br>Now, this vendor has always been there, even pre-COVID but we never bought from him as though nice quality - his prices were a bit high compared to others but since others couldn&#39;t adapt to the paradigm shift and he did, we all now only buy from him as he delivers at door-step and this convenience he provided realizing the opportunity was his success.  <br><br>He now has 6 delivery persons hired. And while due to busy orders, his phone was always busy for calls, he also started taking orders on Whatsapp! While it may sound &#39;so-what&#39; to many, this aged guy, hardly knew how to use smart-phone before Covid so that&#39;s amazing.",

7811,NM-WadrQqWE,"this talk is doomed to go in vain. there is no one miracle solution to poverty. Poverty is a deep rooted economic and social and culture problem that needs every bit of efforts that the whole society has to alleviate. So the question is: does Indians as a country care about its poor people, truly care so that they are ready to pour in valuable resources to help them, from kid nutrition, to education, to creating jobs with dedicated skill training, and building infrastructure for them that you know that will loose money. Without all these, poverty alleviation will happen, but slowly and slowly. If you really interested in poverty alleviation, you should look into how the Chinese community party did in the past 10 years - that is a human level epic project.",

7831,NM-WadrQqWE,"The Banking system in India is still not catering to those who actually need it. I’ll site my own example. In 2015, after I completed my post graduation, I needed loan to open my own clinic. The loan wasn’t so big that the Bank had to fear a default, around 12 lacs! <br>Now I was a fresh pass out from my residency. I had no income tax history. The Banks like SBI advertised that for doctor they are providing doctors loan of Rs 35 lacs without any collateral guarantee!! Now when I went to the Bank, I did all my paper work, submitted everything that was required . The banks never called me back on their own. For next 12 months I kept going to bank visiting the bank manager, who kept giving excuses that it’s stuck in higher center, sometimes they would say one more document is required which the forgot … now in the meanwhile one of their criteria for loan was that I should have a valid rent agreement for my clinic premises. Now I had rented a place for the clinic for that purpose. Now imaging for next 12 months I did not get the loan to start the clinic. But I paid monthly rent of the space without generating any income!! . So I paid rent for 12 months. After more than 12 months. I filed my first income tax file. When I submitted that. Only then My loan was granted!! So you see, even though the advertisement we’re given for loan without any income proof, but the final decision lies on the branch manager. If one does not the branch manager well, or branch manager does not have confidence in you, you will not get the loan. Now after 8 years of practice, the bank managers keep calling me or come physically to my clinic asking me if I have any requirements. The fact that I am a safe client, they are now more than willing!!! This is the story of Indian Banking system!!! It caters to those who have money and want to earn more money!!! But not for those who are in lower income bracket and want to uplift their finances",

Most expensive brands and luxury items that rich people spend billions on has to be created by the poor in some way",
7845,NM-WadrQqWE,"I think Indian government is doing this like  43 crore new bank account after NDA government arrival - jan dhan account, (. and this accounts save lakhs of crore rupees of India every year in fertilizer, farmer 6000rs, vidhva , vradh, divyang pension and free money during covid) , internet connectivity and internet banking in india now become so common that in metropolitan cities a vegetable seller even fruit seller, rickshawala , maid has Paytm, and in village also by new technology of sms banking without internet by dabba mobile this will change Indian village banking. , Third is connecting adhar with account for verification making easily ( and in future all I&#39;d proof from voter to pan to health Card to diving license to other things all with be connected to a single number most probably adhar , I hope property will also) , fourth is 6000 rs to almost every farmer ( nearly 9+ crore farmer out of 14 crore) for small daily agriculture things, and.35 crore loana to various msme , various life insurance, elder age insurance policies,  and literally negligible tax for lower income for house and even lakh lakh rupees free to make homes,. and I am not sure but government maybe using data from UPI to make credibility ranking, only thing left is vey very small loan for any work but government giving it in specific work  , example small loan in mudra yojna, small loan by kisan credit card from 10,000-50 thousand with minimal interest ( 2.5 crore farmers 17percent of total has this card) , 6000 to every farmer, CGFSEL loan in merely 2 percent interst , student credit card with maximum limit of 15000rs. ( I think only students credit card scheme is not popular otherwise all other schemes are promoting and adopting by people quickly) sometimes we need money not for only small education expenses or agriculture expense or small health expenses but in home other works also which are not specify and we don&#39;t have small loan for these otherwise from education to agriculture to health to buisness government is giving credit card for small loans to big big loans also so indian government is doing well than expected very well",

7851,NM-WadrQqWE,"I think here the definition of poor is important, the example assumes that the basic education has been in place first. These examples illustrate people in difficult/ neck to neck  financial condition but it does not reflect the poor of the country. Also the example assumes people in big cities with access to job market. The real situation is however, very different. <br>First the country has to be seen at two layers of urban and rural India, because I do not think the situations faced by residents in either are similar. Then there are layers in both of India&#39;s, layers of poverty and mind that both India would have substantially different layers as the living expenses and potential opportunities are different. <br>Using this as a base, maybe you guys should do this video again. I wish ending poverty was this easy but in the end, it&#39;s all about creating opportunities for people to develop into. As an example, this ITI trainings started by predecessor govt, were amazing tools for people to acquire skills. Probably we need schemes like these to also enter various layers and mind it again, they cannot be the same for all layers.",

How is that good business. If you don&#39;t take care of you employees why should they give their all back to a company where money is more important the their employees security? Right now Indigo Air is the last air line I would trust with my safety. I&#39; d pay a bit more to the competition if they guarantee my safety and that of their air and ground crews,

7979,7QOLDRY_Uk4,Very well explained ☺️,
7980,7QOLDRY_Uk4,Indigo is not a monopoly. It is an astute competitor. Kingfisher was financially sloppy.  You should offer evidence if stating that Airbus planes are more efficient than Boeing&#39;s. They are comparable model to model.,
7981,7QOLDRY_Uk4,"This episode needs to be revised, because Indigo has registered a massive loss after 2019 for seven quarters, and the main reasons are cited to be fuel prices and exchange rate. Note that Indigo had hedged against both these factors. So what went wrong??",
7982,7QOLDRY_Uk4,"Self note :<br>Jet Airways, Kingfisher, etc were major players before 2008.<br>Indian market still in early stages.<br>40-50% of cost is petrol.<br>Indigo has more than 50% market share. Came much later than many airlines. <br>1. Sales and lease model. <br>2. Reduced operations cost. <br>3. Cheap price by providing just the absolute necessity.<br>4. 1000 planes order from AirBus",

7987,7QOLDRY_Uk4,There was no important information on the topic but only repeatation of same one sentence in the whole video,
7988,7QOLDRY_Uk4,Great video ❤️🙌🏻,
7989,7QOLDRY_Uk4,"One very important point to be included for saving cost and having higher efficiency was having the same aircraft type in the fleet. It has only A320 family for single aisle turbofan (A320Ceo, 320Neo, 321N) and ATR for turboprop type. <br>Whereas most other airlines in India operated multiple aircraft type like Air India had 737 and also 319, 320 and 321 for short &amp; medium haul range. Jet had A330 and 777 as their widebody long hauls, Kingfisher had Vistara has 737 and 320s in its fleet. The same manufacturer and aircraft type in fleet increases efficiency by optimization of maintenance and crew training cost, which plays a significant part of cost.",

8028,jGT6ob8hV6M,"I have worked as a Sales Officer for an FMCG brand and I would say, the key to keep your brand running is really keeping the dealers and distributors close to you, just as family! Because it is more than a monetary transaction happening! Seller/Distributor will only seller your product either because of &quot;Demand&quot; or because of his concern towards the company...if you have both then the company can do wonders.",

Quality is not in even the first 5 names in the priority list of asianpaints. They only work on superb branding... which attracts the eventual customer.

8062,jGT6ob8hV6M,"Good coverage. Asian paints an iconic Indian company has changed the landscape unlike any other company. <br>We grew up with the ads of the company and can recall easily. That&#39;s a good way as well to promote along with dealerships. <br>Computerisation as a symbol of modern production is must and it tells in the way profits grow. <br>Employee culture and internal communication is vital which Corporate Governance practices proved. <br>As such we can learn that decentralisation and no intervention in internal management can take a company to heights.  <br>Finally Asian as a brand name has a ring to it. It stands for some values along with ushering good qualities in anew year,  festivals etc., <br>Tough market but branding by association has done marvel to the entity. <br>Way to go. We should know about sustainable practices as the chemical industry is one of the polluting. Next time try to cover such practices as SDG goals are important for nation building.",

8087,jGT6ob8hV6M,What Asian paints bought was a mainframe and not a supercomputer. But still buying a mainframe in 70s is remarkable for an Indian company. Considering the lethargic approach to modernisation by most of the companies of that era barring a few. Let’s not forget even in 2022  (50 years later) the govt office still run everything on paper based files.,

8103,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"It killed itself .it went in the same line of Ambossodor, Nokia,Dunlop,metal box etc way. It didn&#39;t followed the path of development like Fibre optic networks etc It has no vision .<br>Addiding to this 2G Raja to develop his networks politically killed and the story continued",

8106,Wlgk8XXHWuA,And flats are only for 99 years and after 12 years the flats become shit,
8107,Wlgk8XXHWuA,When the BSNL is a government company. Why do they cancel the contracts and opportunity for the company to grow instead of firing the currupted bodies of BSNL and replacing them? And to make it a player in the market for both providing affordable services and getting profits. <br>Instead of making a best one the government had made its own company a failed and miserable one now and making the private owned companies to top.<br>The answer to the thumbnail is here &quot;The government killed its own BSNL&quot;,
8108,Wlgk8XXHWuA,In 2008 national brodband services infotel company&#39; takeover just for 5000 crores rRS ... Next day  reliance in buy 95 percentage shares of infotel company&#39;.. now infotel name chenged as a Jio... 2013 govt given permission to relience Jio not only internet  voice calls also included .....30000 k value service reliance Just paid 5000k rupees only.... To govt .. first 2 jio has no income.. Only outgoing calls.. Jio heavy losses.. So ICR  changes decrease from 30p to 16P ..6p...now nill... All companies imports 4G compunents from chaina... Provide services...but govt says BSNL using Only made in india compunents... Here there is no companies to manufacture 4G compunents how can we BSNL provide 4G... Lost 8 BSNL employees 3 Times do strike for  4G. Permission govt not responding...,
8109,Wlgk8XXHWuA,NDTV could have raised these questions So adanis bought it Democracy is in bad shape,
8110,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Pooh pooh modi,
8111,Wlgk8XXHWuA,bsnl employees attitude is like to slap on them,
8112,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Thanks,
8113,Wlgk8XXHWuA,I appreciate your hard work keep it up you are courageous 🔥,
8114,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Photos of Murasoli Maran and D.Raja (the then telecom ministers) should have been made part of thumbnail of the video rather than the photos of  Mukesh Ambani and Narendra Modi. One of the many reasons of failure of BSNL is bad customer behaviour by their staff. BSNL is good for rural areas only to provide connectivity to the rural citizens.,
8115,Wlgk8XXHWuA,The pic u have put up is wrong.  There may have been conniving  but efficiency is also important.  BSNL was killed in the year 1995 2000 during congress regime,
8116,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Bro why do you think Govt still keeps this worst company alive? They aren&#39;t changing to young management,  they aren&#39;t changing to high quality equipments, there are many money stealing middle men&#39;s..<br><br>Is it cheap for govt to use specialised bsnl for them on people&#39;s tax money?",
8117,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Dont waste your time on a company which bled the indian tax payer of crores of rupees and should have been wound long back,
8118,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Bsnl should have been closed. Or killed long ago .govt should should not be in the business,
8119,Wlgk8XXHWuA,In Vajpayee government telecom minister Pramod Mahajan with Ambani killed BSNL,
8120,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Superb truth explanation,  👌",
8121,Wlgk8XXHWuA,You explained packet switching in a way even my cs teacher can&#39;t do😹😹,
8122,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"I like this channel bcz he focus on the content as primary and then ads in the end of the video so that we would love to watch the video till end 👍, ultimate man😊",
8123,Wlgk8XXHWuA,I would think the main reason is the way BSNL employees behave. Just because of their job security they won&#39;t even answer an enquiry from customer.<br>On other hand even though private networks are costly service is provided in a very gud way. I think this the main reason why people chose other networks over BSNL,
8124,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL has given me the worst services for long.. &amp; all my friends relatives who had BSNL say the same thing,
8125,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL has been used by politicians to loot common man for 3 decades. &amp; It&#39;s initial profit was obvious because of it&#39;s monopoly in the sector for quite long..,
8126,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam DMK(family of robbers of the nation) is a big disease of our nation 🤢💦<br><br>Those above said MFs are still in power and talking sh!t,
8127,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Bsnl की तबाही UPA की सरकार में शुरू हुई तो फिर सिर्फ मोदी का ही फोटो क्यों... आपका कंटेंट अच्छा है लेकिन शो की फोटो में आप न्यूट्रल नहीं दिखते🫢,
8128,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Though you love to speak about all the problems faced by bsnl, you are forced to keep it in a few words that too indirectly.",
8129,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Jai Modi,
8130,Wlgk8XXHWuA,The biggest problem with BSNL is its pathetic customer support service.,
8131,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Tried getting BSNL FTTH in my small town. They made me run pillar to post, call one number after another. None of them wanted to work. After wasting 4 weeks, found a private guy number. Got everything setup and working in 48 hours. Sarkari attitude of their employees is the reason for downfall.",
8132,Wlgk8XXHWuA,I have a BSNL broadband at home🇮🇳<br>BSNL needs to have atleast 25% market share and the government must work towards it to make it profitable.<br>5G is a good opportunity for BSNL,
8133,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"can you work a video on an effective tendering mechanism, which can avoid time loss and ensue effectiveness and less chance of corruption if existing anywhere in other countries??",
8134,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"If govt try to provide service in hill area or the insurgency effected place. Govt just focus on that places. Just for some places govt need not carry out the loss making company. Govt just waste our money in a ruin organisation.<br>Bsnl should be privatized that need to hand over to ambani. He know to revive any company like BSNL<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bsnlprivatisation"">#BSNLPrivatisation</a>",
8135,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Bsns is basically full of irresponsible fools. Who somehow got a job and spending a retired life there.<br>Bsnl officials doesn&#39;t know sla, doesn&#39;t care if connection is down for ages, only thing they know is provide new connection and then torment customers.<br>Been a customer of Bsnl 2 years and struggled because of the fools working in the office and finally switching to a private service provider.",
8136,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Please dont fool people by putting fake thumbnails like modi,ambani. Not everyone who sees the video actually watches it so it creates a negative impact on people&#39;s mind. We all know who are responsible for the loss of BSNL. If u really want to put politicians photos put of those who were in power during that time. <br>Just a humble request 🙏",
8137,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"So, if a Govt. entity handles all critical infrastructure, then how do Developed Economies stabilise their telecom networks? They don&#39;t seem to have any Govt. players?",
8138,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Arrogance, no value for merit, trade unionism, corrupt ministers heading bsnl, all killed bsnl.",
8139,Wlgk8XXHWuA,This what happens when wrong ppl rules our country.. not pinpointing any  individual,
8140,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Don&#39;t withhold the information due to time constraints please. If you could make more videos on same topics and make a playlist out of it. It would be greatly appreciated. Some people like me don&#39;t like to read but listen, watch and retain information as much as possible. So, if you see to it, I&#39;d be very grateful. ✌️",
8141,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"You&#39;re right... I saw BSNL Managers taking bribe allowing jio ppl to sabotage cables to interrupt signal and within 3 months, bsnl customers switched to jio... BSNL has to be privatise with upto 49% stake to private parties.",
8142,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Why there&#39;s photo of modi and Ambani instead of Maran and Raja, it&#39;s this cheap trick just because to get views.",
8143,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"No doubt because of corrupt ministers this happened but at the same time BSNL is filled with corrupt employees and also very lazy work force. No one wants to work because no one can fire them. I personally had BSNL and the service was so poor that I started using my mobile hotspot instead of that and later when JIO came to my area I happily switched to it and till now not even a single issue. <br>So maybe govt companies don&#39;t sucks and they require but 110% most of the govt employee sucks. Until unless we have corrupt ministers in govt and job security in companies, nothing going to change.",
8144,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Govt policies has ruined the corporation ...,
8145,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Mukesh ambani speech still gives goosebumps,
8146,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Lease out all assets it will generate enough revenue to cover losses in next 4-5 years and relaunch with 6g not even 5g!!!,
8147,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Like in case of freebies video this guy made it a point to mention the parties (BJP, Congress, CPI/CPM, TMC, AAP etc.) who are giving freebies in different states. <br>However in this video he does not take name of political parties…. Interesting bias!!",
8148,Wlgk8XXHWuA,misleading thumbnail. disliking.,
8149,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Now pls make an update with 160000 Cr package,
8150,Wlgk8XXHWuA,The government and employees have been killing most of PSUs.. Wise to comment on all  PSUs always,
8151,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Understand how current government supporting Ambani and Adani... Speak about why Adani got 5G,
8152,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Hello Guys , another bit of useful and critical information I wish to add is , Way back in 2002 we engaged and deployed for BSNL a CDN an IP network on its PSTN INFRASTRUCTURE, to deliver convergent services on IP. THIS WAS EXTENSIVELY TESTED ON BSNL NEWORK AND CUSTOMERS IN KOLKATTA , ALTCC Ghaziabad and Bangalore. The same duo of MARAN BROTHERS  and A RAJA KILLED OUR LICENSE , to line their pockets from Chinese companies by deploying low tech broadband equipment. We I SPATIAL COMMUNICATIONS PVT LTD , had a revenue share agreement with BSNL FOR ALL METROS IN INDIA. A BANGALORE BASED COMPANY TOILED INVESTED OUR OWN FUNDS AND DEVELOPED THE TECH WITH NORTH AMERICAN TELCOS. THIS WAS A REVENUE SHARE ARRANGEMENT WITH INVESTMENT FROM US.<br>SO sad to see the efforts thrashed by these power hungry corrupt politicians. “ DATA ONE” WAS THE BRANDING DEVELOPED WITH US. <br>PLEASE DO GET IN TOUCH IF YOU WISH TO KNOW MORE.",
8153,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Customer support was worst,
8154,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"I&#39;m using BSNL since maybe 5 yaers, recently I got 4g sim but work 3g everywhere, but then too BSNL 3g runs like other 4gs and is more consistent that other companies",
8155,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL killed itself much before JIO was born. I myself paid for defunct landline  and broad-band connection for 2 year without being able to use it at all. Also they did not refund the caution deposited. Most of their customers left them.,
8156,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Koi bsnl ko bandh krne ki koshish kub kar. Sakta hai ye socha hai ?  Because of union dadagiri, employ is not wiling to serve people, sarkari babugiri ka behaviour, or bhi reason hai but ye main hai, apko pata hai Ahmedabad ki mills bandh hone ka main Karan majur Mahajan tha. Kyuki jab union only thought about amploye(chori karta pkda gya worker union ki help se vapis aa jata tha ) and not thinking about owner benifit  so finally all mills slowly gradualy close.",
8157,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Why was 4G not alloted to bsnl? <br><br>How is the so called`2G scam&#39; related to BSNL&#39;s fall?<br><br>Why did the supreme court acquit those accused in 2Gscam?<br><br>And finally,<br>Are you running &#39;think school&#39; or &#39;propaganda school&#39;?",
8158,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Done mislead with Modi’s picture. As per your own video BSNL started descending irrecoverably way before Modi came to power.,
8159,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL employees spend more time in their homes than at their job. If you take home big payments and other government benefits but do not deserve it then you are bound to be thrashed.,
8160,Wlgk8XXHWuA,It&#39;s not government problem. Employees not working proper that was reason. 👍,
8161,Wlgk8XXHWuA,There is no way a govt org can do business. Govt job to create regulatory authority and form rules.,
8162,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL is not failed. but Govt made them failed,
8163,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Modi haters opening video after watching thumbnail and getting nailed by think school 😂😂😂😂,
8164,Wlgk8XXHWuA,I&#39;ve not seen a better channel than this.. people like Think School should be rewarded heavily for bringing such insanely valuable information into the public domain which our Education system couldn&#39;t,
8165,Wlgk8XXHWuA,I info here is not full or no full picture. BSNL had biggest network in India but its network was never update to full potential here refering to last 40-50 yr. We were almost last to update internet speed till 2000 when one pvt news channels had highest net speed more than PMO exposed via RTI application.All thanks to then govt IT minister who worked out deal in their favour whitout knowing PMO.  For info govt records govt still hold fastest net speed including satellite internet speed.,
8166,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Besides all bullshits i disliked bsnl of their poor customer service,
8167,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL was a crappy company. During the time you said BSNL made profits I used to be a child and I joked with my friends that BSNL means &#39;Bhai Sahabh Nahi Lagega&#39;!<br>Customers will naturally gravitate towards a company that values them.,
8168,Wlgk8XXHWuA,India is a wonderful land but people&#39;mindset is worst!,
8169,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"BSNL was one of India&#39;s best networks until the privatization era came in. One of the reasons of BSNL&#39;s downfall is JIO Industry and JIO&#39;s Political Connections. As of today, JIO Plan prices are more expensive than any of it&#39;s competitors and BSNL Plan costs half the price of JIO&#39;s.<br><br>(Ignore any grammatical mistakes)",
8170,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Everything about BSNL was hunky dory. It&#39;s true our polical will to promote few private players to gain money power led to downfall. It&#39;s service connectivity etc of course gone bad. If govt not hire engineers, customer care staff and finally good leaders for BSNL, how we can expect. Now we can abuse n discard BSNL.But remember our privacy is now in the hands of few corporates n the infrastructure used by them in remote villages is made out of public money. But still we say Jio ki Jay...sad",
8171,Wlgk8XXHWuA,I do not like this crony capitalist policy by Modi Govt... India as a country should grow and be prosperous not just a few businessmen... This is dangerous for our nation,
8172,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Not only BSNL this government is killing all public sector companies. this is our poor condition that we can&#39;t appose this and we must say this is a great government,
8173,Wlgk8XXHWuA,As a customer no one will go for a company........Where Employees are not respected......<br>The Airtel is growing...just due to the fact that...their customer services are excellent......,
8174,Wlgk8XXHWuA,No one killed  BSNL. It committed suicide .,
8175,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"very good content, but the thumbnail should have shown the actual culprits!",
8176,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"whenever i visited BSNL office i cursed them whole-heartedly, looking at their casual attitude and their poor cust service.  This was bound to happen and every other govt organization should learn from their mistake",
8177,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL WAS KILLED BY THE  COMMUNIST UNIONS.,
8178,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Another sad story of Government in business. Ministers lacking integrity and business skills.,
8179,Wlgk8XXHWuA,What&#39;s the blueprint does Modi Govt. have. for the turn around of BSNL . I&#39;m really worried that till today I am sticking with BSNL. Never tried other operators &amp; I&#39;ve no complaints about the internet service though I&#39;m residing in a metropolitan city.,
8180,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bharatmatakijay"">#BHARATMATAKIJAY</a>",
8181,Wlgk8XXHWuA,And you know the funny part I m watching this vdo over bsnl internet service 🤣🤣,
8182,Wlgk8XXHWuA,I think you are biased....<br>I disliked.,
8183,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Rightly said... something are not about profit.,
8184,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlgk8XXHWuA&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a> Most people just look at money and does know anything else, this is true for all govt institutions like metro, and it is true for all countries",
8185,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Hey this is misleading information. <br>What current government done for BSNL for the past 8 years ?<br>BSNL for sale ?<br>Do you know Airtel is profit making company than JIO ?<br>Please don&#39;t inject wrong information to the public.,
8186,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Politicians and their corruption is pulling the country down. If corruption remains unchecked and guilty not punished, it will destroy our country. Courts should act fast to punish the guilty and put them behind bars. Enforce the fear of law in the guilty minds.",
8187,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"It&#39;s the inefficiency of BSNL and the lethargic attitude of the staff and not being competitive is what brought down BSNL... , If others can pay and buy the licence from BSNL run an enterprise effectively then why can&#39;t BSNL... They are solely responsible for it&#39;s demise !!!",
8188,Wlgk8XXHWuA,From the last time I heard govt sanctions thousand of crores for revival of BSNL and MTNL .. so how’s it get killed ??,
8189,Wlgk8XXHWuA,real truth is corruption is everywhere...wen government wants something then they bring it ..why nobody is taking about 5g scam ?<br><br>if u dont know the issue in  2g was it sold at high price which is 2g scam...where as 5g spectrum is sold much less than 2g ....<br><br>now loan waivers to huge private companies is disastrous than these corruption.,
8190,Wlgk8XXHWuA,&quot;I think their top level management team is the only culprits for the collapse of this company and moreover some of the trade unions especially from the southern states specially from Kerala is also equally responsible for the drowning of BSNL&quot;.,
8191,Wlgk8XXHWuA,bsnl staff killed bsnl. prime example of how corrupt people can sink a revenue generating organisation,
8192,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"BSNL should focus on giving fibre connectivity and Enterprise business, it should give up mobile communication since it might not be very lucrative as the cost of operation is too much and already there is a saturation of mobile density. As the technology in mobile communication is changing rapidly investing for the new generation is mere waste of money",
8193,Wlgk8XXHWuA,modi killed bsnl,
8194,Wlgk8XXHWuA,When u cut the staff then they can&#39;t give service..and when political leaders take decision on their benefits then good government company making losses,
8195,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Bro make video on airtel data and calling charges.,
8196,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Government delayed from giving getting 4G spectrum. My father works in bsnl office since 2000. After india china war in 2019-2020 goverment boycott china goods that&#39;s why bsnl not get 4G spectrum and but now private companies getting the 5G spectrum from china and government don&#39;t give permission in auction of 5G spectrum for bsnl.🥲🤧,
8197,Wlgk8XXHWuA,These are the case study why India Is going towards privatization.<br>1. once people get govt job they stop working<br>2. quota system: beurocracy above meritocracy <br>3. Corruption : 2004 -2014 - Intentionally govt weakened bsnl position,
8198,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Now bsnl is being killed to increase market share of jio. Bsnl does not have funds to run their towers. The fake 2g case was used by Ambani to kill bsnl,
8199,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL service was trash from the beginning. BSNL is like SBI of Network connections.,

8437,IxIi1xTx8zc,"What I do is I follow accounts that are totally against my personal views and like their posts to sort of throw off the algorithm, so far so good",
8438,IxIi1xTx8zc,Bhai aap background me kon saa music use karthe ho,
8439,IxIi1xTx8zc,Ganesh Prasad your videos are very informative and to the point. You have mastered how to simplify information and explain it to us.,

8443,IxIi1xTx8zc,"I don&#39;t get the logic. Tiktok could have shown the video to EVERYONE. Why ONLY the specific viewers? They cannot trust their A.I more than the population of India and the reach of JIO.<br><br>Btw, don&#39;t take me bad. I&#39;m a big fan of this channel after the Lifestyle marketing video. This comment was just me trying to THINK 😄.",
8444,IxIi1xTx8zc,"Social media can actually control us in real life, i had a personal experience. <br>I was a kind of guy who was never into politics, I didn&#39;t even knew the names of many leaders. But when i created an account on Twitter, at the begining everything was normal, but slowly it started filling my mind with political toxicity, i stated arguing with my friend &amp; family because of different political beliefs. I became crazy, arguing with strangers on the internet. <br>But i decided to deactivate my Twitter account and created a new google account for YouTube, as old one was full of political content.<br><br>Now I&#39;m glad that i stopped all those dumb things and removed political toxicity from my mind. Now i mostly focus on my studies and living better life.<br>This was my story how Social media can control our real life actions!",
8445,IxIi1xTx8zc,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxIi1xTx8zc&amp;t=03m20s"">03:20</a> The outrage was because they were not clearing the place in Delhi n also the ones who had already returned to different states weren&#39;t coming out in open to get tested...<br>Later part , where their misbehaviour did happen in hospitals need no explanation..",
8446,IxIi1xTx8zc,"A stupid tik tok channel , a song channel or a roasting channel has millions of followers <br>but people like you who are actually creating awareness and creative thinking abilities has just few thousands shows why our great country has a long a way to go 🚶",
8447,IxIi1xTx8zc,But data collection is important to generate revenue - Facebook has acquired WhatsApp for $ 21Billion - this data collection was bound to happen - in-fact I think Facebook was collecting data before hand and now because fb wants to monetize Whatsapp it made data collection policy public.,
8448,IxIi1xTx8zc,Great conent bro keep it up 👍👍,

8464,IxIi1xTx8zc,"Hey! In one of your video you were pointing out towards the danger that selective coverage of media can cause...but what you did while editing was the same... isn&#39;t it?...you just showed media houses making them villan, but the full news was, they were spitting on roads nearby and even on the corona warriors...with a clear motive of infecting as many people as possible, their intention was the one who was making them &quot;villan&quot;...please think about it too... Thank you! Btw good video keep it up👍🏻",

8467,IxIi1xTx8zc,"Once again an unique video. I appreciate your hard work in making these videos. I learnt something new from this video, thanks a lot.",
8468,IxIi1xTx8zc,"The solution is ver simple my fellow brothers have a sense of rationalism, a sense to question the content that is being shown or watched. NEVER BELIEVE THAT BLINDLY, have your own micro research and develop an individual notion and not try to impose it on others cuz that&#39;s when you become toxic. Male your own approach and viewpoint and keep it to urself and try to just explain it in a healthy debate among your friends, parents etc.",
8469,IxIi1xTx8zc,"“Elon baba” XD , GREAT VIDEO THOUGH🤘❤️",
8470,IxIi1xTx8zc,I dint understand how to delete data can anyone help ? Please,

8473,IxIi1xTx8zc,"Your all the videos like scam1992,  Facebook, case study of MDH and this one are very useful to us thank you",
8474,IxIi1xTx8zc,"Great video! If anyone wants to go deeper into this topic and understand how algorithms manipulate, watch &#39;The Social Dilemma&#39; on Netflix.",
8475,IxIi1xTx8zc,"Amazing, just curious on how you dig up on such vital info, i mean those articles of ndtv, those media footages, finding them was a task. Great job! 💯",
8476,IxIi1xTx8zc,Informative video and cleared all the doubts... amazing work🔥,
8477,IxIi1xTx8zc,🤕🤕,
8478,IxIi1xTx8zc,Love the way u are leading.. Keep on. 👍,
8479,IxIi1xTx8zc,Agrred with those viral tiktok videos but <br>The news about Tablighi jamaat was true... because the police said that some of those ppl were hiding intentionally (phones were off) when the police and health workers were trying to tress them for quarantine and that&#39;s what led to more spread of virus.,
8480,IxIi1xTx8zc,"Your case study are really wonderful,,,,, I feel energetic after watching your content in terms of information,,, really amazing👏👏👍👍👍👍",
8481,IxIi1xTx8zc,"Two minutes silence for those who disliked the video.....<br>Ganesh sir, u r awesome 🔥🔥🔥",

8483,IxIi1xTx8zc,Nice secular video... What happened in USA we have seen what these tech company can do.We had already suffered due to east india company .We now need strict law to regulate these company.,

8487,IxIi1xTx8zc,You are doing good work 🙂🙂,
8488,IxIi1xTx8zc,Fabulous content as usual 🔥🔥❤️❤️,
8489,IxIi1xTx8zc,WhatsApp used share data to other applications from long back some time not it&#39;s just asking ur permission,
8490,IxIi1xTx8zc,People who knows about the data security and privacy will not easily get influenced by the contents of social media. But whatsapp and Facebook has a billions of users who don&#39;t understand all these technical sides and they will continue using the platform because they are used to it. People will switch from whatsapp only if there is no whatsapp and I don&#39;t think that is gonna happen anytime soon.,
8491,IxIi1xTx8zc,Good job!<br>Definitely an eye opener<br>Hope such issues are solved,
8492,IxIi1xTx8zc,Sir what if  someone hasn&#39;t made account on facebook?,
8493,IxIi1xTx8zc,Amazing one.. 👍👍 <br>But you know that the coming generations will be more loaded to this internet and social media..How we can make them aware of the same.. ? What is the permanent solution for this.? It is going to be big and bigger.. but wish It could get less and minimal..🤞🤞,
8494,IxIi1xTx8zc,Elon baba 😂😂,
8495,IxIi1xTx8zc,Great.,
8496,IxIi1xTx8zc,Amazing 💯 the time that you have taken to make this video is worthy💯,

8500,t-VpFrqd0W0,"Nice video, the hit of the pandemic has shaking the foundation of how we do things as humans especially socializing. But many sees <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metaverse"">#metaverse</a> as a tool that has the potential to curb some of the challenges that the pandemic brought. Though most of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metaverse"">#metaverse</a> projects on the market now are into gaming and virtual concerts, with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stepapp"">#StepApp</a> pushing the limits of this Tech in the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fitness"">#Fitness</a> industry, it won&#39;t surprise me if <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metaverse"">#metaverse</a> is applied to other aspects of our lives.

8510,t-VpFrqd0W0,"I don&#39;t know what organisation you are talking about but I have worked for a bunch of preety big organisations and the number 1 rule in all of them was you are never supposed to present an independent alternative thought or present a honest opinion or problem to your senior.

8512,t-VpFrqd0W0,Thanku sir for a excellent session 👍,
8513,t-VpFrqd0W0,"Good insight about Metaverse. While out of my curiosity , I have read and listened few other sources about Metaverse - people gave out their imagination how this is going to be used .. <br><br>One among them which I felt amazing is:<br><br>A specialized surgeon who generally visits other places currently occasionally &#39;coz of travelling issue - will be able to contribute now through Metaverse easily. In an operation theatre along with the doctors performing - this surgeon can be present as an avatar - go around 360 degrees to get the exact understanding and guide the performing doctors what need to be done.<br><br>No Technology is good or bad as per me - it&#39;s all about how we make use of it. Same would be with metaverse also.<br><br>I would look forward for a video from you - which talks about possible business opportunities using metaverse .",
8514,t-VpFrqd0W0,Wow the minute you started explaining humans from apes to rulers.. I was reminder of Sapiens.. great job as always Ganesh.. I would love to be a part of your stall at metaverse,
8515,t-VpFrqd0W0,Plz do Fundamental analysis of KPR Mills,
8516,t-VpFrqd0W0,All current tech and social media would become history as soon as it reaches the majority. One of it&#39;s advantages would be kill of social media sites and it&#39;s negative mental effects,
8517,t-VpFrqd0W0,example - Nuclear Power when discovered was first used to create the Atom Bomb not Power Plants....So its always subjective and on us only how we use the knowledge. If we are good people we will for a case like the NGO use case and if we are going bad or run away from reality we become similar to what Surrogates movie showcased,
8518,t-VpFrqd0W0,In India we may end up having Metaverse riots 🙄🙄,
8519,t-VpFrqd0W0,Thanks!,
8520,t-VpFrqd0W0,"all the tech is already present, but are we using it to its full capacity?

8523,t-VpFrqd0W0,Metaverse is just a product to keep you engage with company and do their business.  Your opinion is bias and not showing other/negative side of it.,

8525,t-VpFrqd0W0,"tell me one thing. what&#39;s the basic utility of a mobile.- to communicate. After whatsapp came, F2F communication has come down. rather they r communicating thru mobile.",
8526,t-VpFrqd0W0,That is really a bogus technology which will never go in mainstream just like bitcoins. It is hype,

8551,t-VpFrqd0W0,You are awesome 👍👍,
8552,t-VpFrqd0W0,Meta Verse is only helpful for specific area.(not for daily use ),
8553,t-VpFrqd0W0,Metaverse  is a waste of time. It will put more and more people indoors which will have a negative affect on the mental and emotional health. Well time will tell how and where this technology will take mankind. Second life was a prime example of such metaverse failure. Just my thoughts.,
8554,t-VpFrqd0W0,"The potential negative consequences far exceed the positive ones. Considering how woefully ill equipped governments are at regulating tech, the negative consequences are going to dominate. Just look at how divided society has become as social media grew in adoption.",
8555,t-VpFrqd0W0,This video gave me a whole new perspective of looking at metaverse. Thankyou think school ❤️,
8556,t-VpFrqd0W0,hence meta will kill your livelihood and u will end up in a virtual world with highly red-colored eyes causing health issues,
8557,t-VpFrqd0W0,What were the fun activities that you had that opened up people for brainstorming?,
8558,t-VpFrqd0W0,"First of all, who the hell are these people who get so much time to waste during office hours? Where do they come from? And By the way, attrition rate is not going to come down because of a virtual world meeting sessions. It depends on factors like money ,work culture etc.. And, a toxic work culture will feel even more toxic in virtual world where senses are high. Your video is good but with wrong analogies. You need to get a real world office job to understand how actually project deliverables happen in office. Your Teaching sessions job is not going to help understand these things.",
8559,t-VpFrqd0W0,I mean like bruh will we need to just live in this world then we wont even know our body and we when we see our selves in the mirror be like who tf? Are you and then to realise that all that we experiencenced was fake just like ready player one,

8578,t-VpFrqd0W0,what if neura link and meta would collaborate? Then with neuralink technology there would be no need of Oculus and joystick like console for using meta (musk and zuck might bury the hatchet),

HE wastes no time in allowing himself to be compared to the English fool called James Bond a man whose  only capabilities in life are gimmicks, fast cars and seducing women. If thats what Indians super spy is all about we may as well hand the keys to our border to China.  Doval shows off our &quot;strategies&quot; our heavy weapons emplacements and boasts of our equipment and arms and what these are to be used for&gt; China in such circumstances do not require to spend millions on intelligence gathering. Doval is acting the same way Krishna Menon did prior to 1962. KM showed Chou En Lai where our defences were placed which made it a cake walk for Chinese troops to overrun un in 1962. IN GAlwan   Gen&gt; Naravane failed to tell us our electronic intelligence had been hacked and interdicted which gave the Chinese a huge advantage over our troops.",

I told him that i did my best for the preparation but he didnt buy it at all. He thought i&#39;m lying. He didn&#39;t even listen to my explanation and keep criticizing me. Even though he , me and my friend we all work together for interview preparation and he also knows our skills very well, he didn&#39;t trust me at all. Treat me like I&#39;m a piece trash.

8771,fnO6UfeplxE,Brilliant👍,
8772,fnO6UfeplxE,"Any one who has achieved a top position if we look at, they reached there through their talent, handwork and feedback system they built - But, unfortunately what happens is after certain time - the feedback system doesn&#39;t work &#39;as initially - let me put my point through an example<br><br>A famous director who has given 5 block busters .. Imagine how much thought process would have gone into during story finalization, script making, shooting , post production etc., Every time while the director discusses with his feedback channel - initially there is every possibility the channel would be coming out with their views, thoughts, apprehensions towards the decisions taken etc.,<br><br>But as no one know which will work - finally they will be agreeing at some point and in that there would be enough places where they may have not felt fully convinced with the director. But, when they see those areas well accepted by audience and movies become hit one after one - the feedback channel gets to a stage knowingly or unknowingly that the director thought process is right than what they are thinking and they may not be giving feedback in the same way they used to do initially.<br><br>That&#39;s why we see successful directors, leaders, entrepreneurs do commit mistakes at their peak stager.

But due to USA was pressured to declare bangldesh as a pakistan country.<br>India gave independance to the bangladesh. But now time is different , bangladesh is going into the hands of rhe USA now in 2022 and leaving hands of the Russia , when Russia will become now superpower. <br>So till now , bangladesh will get money from the USA , but what after 2024? When USA got bankrupt  , and they dont have money or commodities.<br>So now in 2022 , bangladesh GDP will increase. But afted 2024 , USA stock market will goes down and dedollarisation will goes on , they ask to pay all money with interest. So bangladesh will give back all , when USA will goes bankrupt .<br>Bangladesh GDP will goes down like Shrilanka. And then bankrupt the country.<br>So for this time , nor USA is better for taking money and nor china.<br>As you know chinese money goes in shrilanka and noe shrilanka is bankrupt country.<br>That is india is doing rightnow. And if you dont know , if you see in news channels that india and china is fighting , but in reality india- china and Russia is now freinds from inside. They dont show freindship from inside , but they help each other when they are in emergency needs.<br>So from this new freindship bringing more wealth. And china now agree to invest in india also. <br>So thats why indian projects were handeled by chinese plants under make in india projects. This freindship , USA dont like , because of the USA is not getting commodities from the india , china and russia.<br>Thats why UK is sacrificed in this ukraine war , and USA hide his plans with UK. Now UK is under biggest economy blast. Even africa like poor countries dont want to send commodities in USA and Urope. So the whole world think that dollar can anytime crash , and stock market will fell more than 80% . And dollars will wipe out from the stock market. 😁😁<br>This is showing insecurity of the dollar , thats why whole world is now hiding their money into the safe countries like india , indonesia , bangladesh. And they are gaining strengh.<br>Because of the every business person around the world thinking that my money will be saved in great recession comes in USA after 2023. And india and bangladesh is safest country that provides great rerurns also. They wont affected by the Uropean stock market crash.",

8852,_VdKPmtzuqs,"Another thing I would like to point out that Bangladesh is the only country in the world to have female heads of State serving more time than their men counterpart. Women know how to run their homes with efficiency, they know what&#39;s best for the well being of their children. Bengalis in general are far more outward and liberal in terms of women empowerment, the biggest festival of Bengal is Durga Puja that celebrates the mother Goddess.<br>I believe having women in their leadership role helped them to stay out of unnecessary skirmishes/wars and focus their resources solely for the upliftment of their citizens.<br>I have massive respect for the current Bangladeshi PM Hasina, daughter of the legendary Bangabandhu, her visionary leadership have turned Bangladesh as a significant player in Asia. Well done.",

Still India&#39;s percapita is higher than Bangladesh it had came down only during pandemic.... And doesn&#39;t makes sense to compare a matured and major economy with an emerging minor economy India has developemental disparity percapita comes down because Up bihar huge population but low percapita compared to others South states, Gujrat, Mahrashtra are better Industrialised and developed which has higher nominal gdp than Bangladesh and percapita 2.5-3 times more...Bangladesh might be doing better than Bihar but that doesn&#39;t draw the picture for whole India....",
8856,_VdKPmtzuqs,I dont know how to trust u when Bangladesh is on an economic downturn at the moment when you made this video. While india is thriving in international markets as GBP value go down as INR rise. Please don&#39;t persuade people with ur false intentions<br><br>Why I mean India thriving Is when all of Europe is on oil n gas crisis india is thriving nd as well its about to make INR international exchange currency so that&#39;s huge compared to what Congress achieved or any south asian nation did,
8857,_VdKPmtzuqs,Fast growth is not important being a stable economy is important. Now see how Bangladesh is struggling by taking cheap lone from china.,

8860,_VdKPmtzuqs,Now Bangladesh is in economical crisis,
8861,_VdKPmtzuqs,India must learn the lesson from Bangladesh how to provide money in the hands of poor for business not for saving in the millions of bank accounts. Free food free money no use even poor will get more poorer,
8862,_VdKPmtzuqs,As a Bengal 1971 is the worst yeah,

8879,_VdKPmtzuqs,"With excellent graphic works, the contents are one of the best for easy understanding.<br>In fact, with 3 million Bangladesh deaths in the 1971 Indo-Pak war, there is more than 7000 Indian Soldiers&#39; Blood were sacrificed. In present days, whatever geo-political issues exist between the 2 nations, Indo-Bangladesh friendship is based on &quot;Blood-Ties&quot;. As an ailing freedom fighter of the 1971 liberation war, I recall, in addition to feeding 10 million refugees, Indiraji, all-Indian Great Leader Jay Prakash Narayan, and other congress leaders for blind support and building world opinion in favor of the liberation war and, against Pakistani atrocities, arsons, raping looting, and killing. No match of such a humanitarian act could be found anywhere in history in centuries for extending cooperation and, managing the refugee crisis that Indiraji and the entire Indian Nation did.",

8882,_VdKPmtzuqs,India is sucking Bangladesh right now. They helped us not for free. They took Kolkata and many MORE things and right now Bangladesh is faceing floods because of the help of indian barriers they have created. They’re sucking Bangladesh in many other things also. We hate india now. In Sylhet many people died with the help of indian barriers.,

8884,_VdKPmtzuqs,"India Isn’t losing, people living in India are stupid. Any change that is presented, people go out and destroy shit in the name of protest of that law. Change can’t come unless you’re willing to accept change. People wanna live with old economic laws and expect the government to give them jobs, development, etc etc. Plus, Bangladesh doesn’t have to deal with countries like China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc. Bangladesh relies on textile so much so that if India stops exporting cotton to Bangladesh, it’s entire economy would drop.",

Hitler used Zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the fumant removed.  It causes symptoms like corona virus.  Look up in the sky you will see planes spraying your cities!  Hitler attacked Russia, just like what is happening now.  The British Empire had no legal male Heir so they imported a fake one from Germany.  The British Queen&#39;s husband &quot;Prince Philip&quot; renounced his German citizenship, became a Greek citizen and as a Greek citizen moved to Britain gaining citizenship there.  After gaining citizenship, he was appointed a Duke, out of thin air and then as a Prince and married Queen Elizabeth.  &quot;Prince Philip&quot; took the name of the Queen, not the other way, as it usually is done, where a wife takes the husband&#39;s name.  The British Empire has run out of male Heirs at least twice, and they kill to suppress it.    WW2 was a way of hiding this fraud, and now WW3 is a way of hiding that illegal combines Heir. The Bible says that a male would not fail to sit on the throne.  A family name continues through the males, not the females, and Philip was a fraud.  He had become a Greek citizen to make it appear that he was a Royal from the earlier Greek dynasty.</b>  Total theater.  <b>The Catholic Empires of the Roman Empire form one leg and the UK(British controlled) Empire forms the other leg of the Roman Empire, with the King Pope Francis as the ruler of the whole system.  He has a triple teired crown with 666 on it in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  He is a King of the city state of the Vatican(the Vatican is the smallest Country in the world), Rome Italy, and is mentioned in Revelation, Apocalypse, 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions that this Empire is responsible for all those slaughtered on earth.  It mention what the leaders wear, which is scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  The UK leg Royals also wear those colors, a long with Judges and Magistrates of the Crown.  They refer to this entity as the Crown.  When some one goes to court in one of the British subservient Nations, it is said that the Crown has a case against the person.</b>  Canada, Australian and others are not sovereign or free.  please read Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, and study it closely, because this Empire comes as a false system claiming to represent God, but exterminates to stay in power.  <b>1Timothy3:1-16 mentions that the one looking after a group(Church) should be a husband of one wife with obedient children.  The Pope and the Priests of the Catholic Church are forbidden to marry, and so don&#39;t even qualify, according to the very book and God they say they claim to represent(an unmarried man has no wife or children.)   The Bible&#39;s Peter&#39;s mother in-law was cured by Jesus(Yeshua).  So if Peter had a mother in law, then he had a wife as there is no other way.</b>  That is why Catholic Priest have sex with so many little boys, girls and women attendees.  <b>There was over ninety cases of Preists molesting little boys in the city of Boston, USA alone.  None of the Priests were disciplined, but were only moved to a different location, and now you know why.  The whole system is a fraud.</b>  So this organization has many false teachings.  <b>The Roman Emporer forced a combining of Biblical and Pagan beliefs, when Rome Nationalized the Church.  Rome forbid the celebration of Biblical Holy days and Sabbaths under threat of beatings, then confiscation of property and finally death.   Many beheaded or burned alive.</b>  Revelation Apocalypse 18:4 says get out of this organization &quot;my people&quot; if you don&#39;t want to receive her plagues.  <b>Freedom to communicate is under attack by Church and State, up to the point they are threatening to bomb the microprocessor production facilities.</b>  Pray for me and you, please!  <b>Russia says they have the proof that Britain was involved in at least thres major terror attacks against Russia.</b>  Would Russia bomb their own 5+ Billion pipeline, their own bridge, powerplants and Navel yards?  <b>NATO said that they would attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize their island, because Australia would feel threatened, but NATO was militarizing Ukraine, where they had bunkers full of weapons.  NATO&#39;s puppet regime in Ukraine was banning the Russian language and culture even though that was many people&#39;s only language.  The Ukrainian Capital is a Russian word until Western media changed it to hide the Russian history, as Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a recent NATO coup, which the US planned, as they told their dignitaries not to attend the Russian Olympics at that time. You could go to prison for teaching the Russian language. All opposition parties in Ukraine (banned).  Those with out blue arm bands(now yellow?) being put to death.</b>  Many US Officials had been talking about a coming war with Russia and China.  Years in advance.  <b>Donald J Trump said he couldn&#39;t answer corona virus questions claiming we are at war.</b>  Trump said that the US will soon be at war with Russia and China. <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, but are part of China, as acknowledged by most nations of the world till recently.</b>  NATO is planning to do to Taiwan and China what they did to Ukraine and Russia.  <b>Britain fighting for Democracy in Ukraine?  Britain has had two or three Prime Ministers that have not been ellected, trying to help the naked Emporer.</b>  Think!  <b>Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband&#39;s attack is a fraud.  The Police changed and contradicted the events multiple times and it makes no sense.</b>  Corona virus is a code name for information that exposes the crown(Government/Royals).  A vaccine is computer/electronic device program that deletes information from your view(anti virus software).  Symptoms for a biological virus comes from being gased, radiated or sprayed in your environment.  <b>Planes fly in parallel patterns, causing heating of your environment and breathing difficulties.  Like Hitler killed by Zyklon B gas, so now they use a deadly gas in incubators.</b>  Donald J Trump said he would put Hilary R Clinton in prison when ellected for starting a war and genocide in Libya, but when he got in power did nothing.  Americans have started many unjust wars.  <b>America/NATO is about to start wars with Ethiopia, Haiti, Taiwan, Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the list goes on.  NATO Countries have invaded more than half of all sovereign Nations on earth, in the last 30 years.</b>  When you print money on paper and then go buy things with it, and it is not backed by any thing then you have to attack a lot of people to keep the scheme going.  <b>New Central Bank digital currencies(CBDCs) will be centralized and backed only by cow farts and trust, where as Bitcoin is decentralized and backed by gold.  Bitcoin/gold and silver came under a major attack by the crown(governments).  The digital currencies will create a M.O.B. type system, that if you get in government cross hairs you will be shut out of the system just like Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Russia and so on and so on.  If they do it to a complete Country, then they will have no problem doing it to individuals.  Canada confiscated people&#39;s money breaking international law.</b>  Rome enters a Country, exterminates, and keeps the remaining people&#39;s in refugee camps called Reserves.  Periodically they thin out the population.  They usually make a lot of noise about sport team names with Native names and how people are trying to erase their names, so as to hide the real erasure of actual peoples.  <b>Revelation 7:9, God says he would take out of all Nations and Tribes and Peoples a people for himself.  God accepts all those who accept him of all Nationalities.</b>  Donald J Trump started operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American people by military nurses.  Trump added death by electrocution, firing squad, poison gas to the already used lethal injection.   <b>Trump foretold war on Russia and China years in advance, a said no one would protect the Pope more than him.</b>  America turned it&#39;s back on God, so now he is turning his back on you.  <b>The US, Canada, Germany, Italy, Britain, Australia, Austria, Ukraine and many other Nations refused to agree and voted against a move at the United Nations to condemn Nazism.  Russia voted against Nazism.  Remember the Nazis?  They started WW2 and exterminated 12000000 human beings, often by extremely cruel means.  The Ukraine military has a entire Nazi battalion the Azov Nazi battalion.  Church leaders clearly seen in Hitler&#39;s Nazi SS footage blessing the troops before slaughters.  The Azov Steel Works was full of Nazis that surrendered to Russia, with pictures confirming their Nazi swastikas tattooed on their bodies.</b>  Ukraine banned all opposition parties and is trying to exterminate the Russian language, people and culture.  Teachers are sent to prison for teaching the Russian language in areas where most only speak Russian.  <b>Fighting for Democracy?</b>  Britain installed two Prime Ministers that were not elected.  <b>Donald J Trump used his office while President to start a business so called &quot;Truth Social&quot; that he claimed would enable free speech.  Later Mr.Trump tried to get the Justice department to stop late night hosts from talking about him.  So supposedly creating free speech over here, but attacking free speech over there.</b>  Russia and China no longer accept US fiat currency, so G7 banned Russian gold. Supposed unbiased media not allowing comments, is a mass deception and contrary to their purpose. CBDCs attacking crypto. 1933 the US confiscated gold.   For 50 years, 10 years in prison for having it, and only ended when gold was separated from backing money in 1971 now backed by cow farts. 2022 Biden bans Russian gold.  Military wearing US/UK flags in Ukraine. UK/Rome&#39;s &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;²;!;-::-:",

The barrier can be set low, so that many can enter. However, you just can&#39;t make it that all Tom, Dick and Harry can enter at will, take a dump, and then leave the premises.

We are about to see a new Shopify emerge in this space with these three features, fulfilling the Govt&#39;s purpose for ONDC. However, in my view, this SaaS platform should have some level of offline presence for training and quality control of its offline retail partners. Like Swiggy did with its restaurant owners.",

9023,kXvwHAeWYqs,"I have noticed many times in the last 10 overs, Dream11 manipulates points, even if your players selected is playing from both ends, that is striker and non striker and scoring runs and the bowler bowling is not picked in your team, at this time your points should be in the green and not still be in the red. I have noticed several times they are definitely manipulating to make sure that they have more number of participants money is lost, so that Dream 11 can make more money. Normally the participants do not look at these things and thinks ok fine I lost. Check this out till the last ball is bowled you would see many times when you are about to just win, they will suddenly show the participants in loosing  zone. This is my experience only, I don&#39;t know if others have noticed this. Definitely Bots are used in several matches to win the games",
9024,kXvwHAeWYqs,When are we expecting Think School Kannada?,
9025,kXvwHAeWYqs,Sonu sharma networking wale bhaiya may feel bad about network marketing / multi level marketing pseudo scam 😉 😵‍💫,
9026,kXvwHAeWYqs,I think Poker is more skill based than this Fantasy sports...and Poker is still considered gambling....So &quot;Kudos&quot; to the court decisions :D...,
9027,kXvwHAeWYqs,"I&#39;m not fully agree with you... There are many advantages of playing fantasy sports....<br>1) It increases your ability of decision making<br>2) Observing small things <br>3) Analytical skills<br>4) Statistical skills <br> As we all everything has two sides... If you are playing for  long time it does not require that much of time... You already know how a player plays , how he has been performing..  and whoever big companies are available in the market everyone is making money from something, even Google makes money from our data.... No offence btw ,I&#39;m just presenting my POV.",
9028,kXvwHAeWYqs,You can select 7 players from one team max. This analysis was nothing special. Your Title of Dream11 exposed is misleading,
9029,kXvwHAeWYqs,"hi would you please lessen the background music volume. as you talk about serious and interesting content,  this bgm is very disturbing and defocusing.  thanks for your amazing videos. we learn a lot from your channel.  🙏",
9030,kXvwHAeWYqs,The cricketers who endorse this have no brain hence proved . Younger generation is blinded by their idols and the idols are indirectly looting their money like this.,
9031,kXvwHAeWYqs,In no way you proved that Dream 11 is a fraud. 😑,
9032,kXvwHAeWYqs,great video,
9033,kXvwHAeWYqs,Arey ismey fraud kaha hey bhai?,
9034,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Great explanation and great video once again. Your videos share abundance of knowledge without any research, do make more videos on money related. The whole set of videos, if grouped according to the topics.. can be invaluable learnings for the Biz students.",
9035,kXvwHAeWYqs,You&#39;re absolutely right we should not waste our time on such things,
9036,kXvwHAeWYqs,Please make a video to expose your thinking as well ... :) lol....,

9038,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Bro one important thing you missed out.   I know this since I am hardcore technology guy.  Dream 11 doesn&#39;t  make just 20% of overall commission on a group money.  They also have (ssshhhh) BOT!, which will be introduced at the middle of the game with real name in it.  You don&#39;t have absolutely no control at the end of the match, who are all these people toping in the end and you have been thrown out!    Its all algorithm.  easy to manipulate.  Dream11 knows nobody has time to collect  3 Lakh people team writing down  at the beginning of the match to analyze.",
9039,kXvwHAeWYqs,hey big brother. can you please a video on polycab wires company. would love to hear case study on that company. thanks,
9040,kXvwHAeWYqs,we can pick 7 players from a team,
9041,kXvwHAeWYqs,"I played few matches with dream 11. Soon realised that there can be an algorithm that runs depending on match situation and creates new participants eventually winning the prize. These are my thoughts, I may be wrong. Lost around 1k and decided never to play again.",
9042,kXvwHAeWYqs,we want kannada,
9043,kXvwHAeWYqs,Then horse racing gambling is not gambling 🙄,
9044,kXvwHAeWYqs,More of a promotion of Dream 11,
9045,kXvwHAeWYqs,I am waiting for think school in Kannada,
9046,kXvwHAeWYqs,💖💓💖,
9047,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Just 23 Crore match <br>5000000x46 = 230,000,000 so they just taking people Money and giving to someone for thag they taking comission so it&#39;s clear Dream 11 has no investment they taking our money as investment and making huge money by promoting ads it&#39;s clearly a gambling that&#39;s why these apps not available on Play Store bec playstore won&#39;t allow gambling apps now who is really fool here 🤦",
9048,kXvwHAeWYqs,Todays RCB vs CSK match winner correctly choose Moeen ali as C &amp; Teekshana as VC how it&#39;s possible? Previous match rutu devon combo played vert well today 80% people choose only both of them as captain Definitely dream 11 cheating us by changing results,
9049,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Pure gambling , youth wasting time and money.",
9050,kXvwHAeWYqs,Can you please throw more light into how much the players on whose name the company is earning money are being compensated for their name and appearance? It seems weird that no player is enraged by inclusion off their name in this app?,
9051,kXvwHAeWYqs,"I have won 30 lakhs, 5 lakhs and 1 lakhs in Grand league. Yes D11 can be addictive but it has changed future of many poor and middle class people. Spending just 10-15 mins a day is fine in creating a D11 team instead of wasting 6-7 hours on Insta, FB, YT. You never know you might get lucky one day and earn millions of rupees which is very very important in today&#39;s life.",
9052,kXvwHAeWYqs,"If possible, kannada version please, would like share all these to my friends and family.",
9053,kXvwHAeWYqs,So dream11 is a share market in future. <br>WTF,
9054,kXvwHAeWYqs,Pls make ur case studies for people speaking  and thinking  in Hindi language,
9055,kXvwHAeWYqs,"It is complete gamble,It is not like stocks where AC&#39;s are sold in Summer and Tractors in Rainy season.Dhoni can surely get out after scoring 5 hundreds at Chennai.",
9056,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Government doesnt care about the cheating with Bots , they want tax thats it . If this happens in europe, Dream 11 closes in a day due to strict gambling rules( due to the company bots which win ) . But india will not care about common people anyway 😂😂😂",
9057,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Sir, what is 4p&#39;s of dream 11??plz tell",
9058,kXvwHAeWYqs,It has been a wonderful journey with think school Aprrox 2 years <br>Dubbing videos in regional languages is a very great thing you are going to become a great youtuber in few years hope you grow a lot for providing knowledgeable and time worthy content,

9060,kXvwHAeWYqs,"May be fantasy games are legally safe, but ethically it is not.",
9061,kXvwHAeWYqs,"gambling directly on cricket is illegal coz it is considered as a game of chance while gambling indricetly on fantasy sport is legal coz that is a game of skill, sahi mei kanoon andha hota hai",
9062,kXvwHAeWYqs,Sad to see top sports people promoting such a platform...,
9063,kXvwHAeWYqs,dream 11 is 10% skill 20% probability(creating multiple combination) and 70 % luck to be at top 1% in my opinion,
9064,kXvwHAeWYqs,"🔴🔴🔴One more information to add which is very important 🔴🔴🔴<br><br>Dream 11 has other way of earning money- In a contest of big leagues like 2 crore, 3 crore or any other high winning leagues, there are many participants who participate. For example like in the above video there was a contest which had 3 lakh participants. Among the 3 lakh participants, hardly 50 thousand people participate. The remaining 2.5 lakh participants are added as bots with different names by Dream 11 company with all possible permutations and combinations of players. This makes the bots(Dream 11) win everytime because of the different combinations of players. This is the reason even though there are so many big money winning contests going on everyday, there are only few persons who reported winnings publicly. This is other source of income for dream 11 because they win money in the big contests and the 50 thousand participants either win very less amount or mostly no money at all.",
9065,kXvwHAeWYqs,awesome,
9066,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Here&#39;s the detail we missed out on<br><br>Dream 11 gives you free credit worth ₹200 with a new account, and the biggest pools have a low entry bar, &lt; ₹100 <br>So what happens is that almost all the money in the pool is basically dream11&#39;s own free credit. And any money any player wins is going out of their pocket.<br><br>What they started doing is that they&#39;d make 100s of random bot entries with each possible combination of players and in the bag the entire winnings home.<br><br>Players would usually win a few rupees at best and most will never even make enough to hit the minimum withdrawal threshold, so they&#39;d pump in more of their cash, fail again and then one fine day, get rid of the app",
9067,kXvwHAeWYqs,"If you have to any real chance of winning just not by pure luck, you need to have enormous data to guess anything at all, and there is certain fixed uncertainty for each batch like playing 11 , you will probably need a computer program to guess mostly all the possible combinations . It&#39;s a skill based game but NONE of the common people have it .",
9068,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Cricket is a game, managed by the rich politicians of India, In simple terms BCCI is a mafia, its not a government agency.  Every player is sitting on a money bench, and digital viewers are the Fulfillment model for business. <br><br>IPL... what a platform, a normal cricketer gets to earn crores in just 2 months ... why not when it&#39;s managed like and by a mafia. <br><br>I feel we should have nationalist approach towards building skills when it comes to players,  if that rs 50 is contributed to a digital platform that funds Indian Olympic association would lead to create a better value and future for our country. <br><br><br><br>Mafia is created to control the young brains of our country.",
9069,kXvwHAeWYqs,All are part of the gambling game political parties everyone 🤔🤬😡,
9070,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Main problem is the wrong definition of the gambling ... The host of this video also wrongly interpret the gambling.. simply put, gambling is any activity where. There is always a win lose situation and one party gains the wohe or  part of the money on the expense of others lose... <br>But other hand business or trade is not win lose situation but a win win situation...",
9071,kXvwHAeWYqs,Watching ads of dream 11 just before knowing their scam is also good 🙂,
9072,kXvwHAeWYqs,you forgot to mention about TDS. haha,
9073,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Man, regional channels? Just wow",

9077,kXvwHAeWYqs,If the dream11 is doing exactly the way you are telling that is okay. but they are doing some different tactics here. 1)Out of 3 lacs team they will make a 2lacs team by bot system  2)they will release a pdf file of the team after 10min. If the opening batsman out within 10min they will remove that player from their team.,
9078,kXvwHAeWYqs,Very good content!!!,
9079,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Not all 30 lakhs to dream11, where the tax going then",
9080,kXvwHAeWYqs,Game of chance,
9081,kXvwHAeWYqs,"We all know that anything can happen in a cricket match and even if something is very predictable (like mi winning 2020 final) everyone would know that and keep max players from mi. So it&#39;s not wise to invest time , money and energy altogether and still &quot;hope&quot; for profits. Great advise in the end of this video.",
9082,kXvwHAeWYqs,"As an Asian these are my analysis why Russia invaded Ukraine ,prove me wrong with facts:<br>1. Natural resources recently discovered (gas and oil) around Crimea and Donbass..<br>2. Donbass region and Eastern Ukraine is &quot;bread basket&quot;, so for food security.<br>3. land bridge to Crimea (strategic importance).<br>4. Steel centers like Mariupol and Krivij Rog  is a major metallurgy center of Europe, not just Ukraine.<br>And when you see how Russian armies kill innocent it is obvious they are after those things, not some made up gibberish about fighting Nazis/ fascism.

9085,kXvwHAeWYqs,very well explained,
9086,kXvwHAeWYqs,Dhoni fraud insan hai,
9087,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Had seen a similar documentary in US. US also has the exactly same rule, gambling by chance is banned but gambling by luck is not. <br>Evidently these companies showed example of 2-3 people who  usually wins, to assert that it takes skills to win. Interestingly, the people who were winning were machine learning engineers. Who would take as many data points as possible and then take the decision. They even factored in the humidity, social media buzz of a player.<br>I&#39;m pretty sure these people can hack the dream 11 too.",
9088,kXvwHAeWYqs,Surely a game of betting and gambling. But IPL is a conglomerate in itself and it will shield all its minions because of massive revenue generation and boost to economy,
9089,kXvwHAeWYqs,Please put video on byjus and how casinos make money??,
9090,kXvwHAeWYqs,It is still a gambling game.....  if we take the skill then people will say that virat kohli will bat at 3 but one game india experiments and send shivam dube at 3 and he makes a half century ....so here nobody knew india will try to send another player instead of virat kohli this was pure luck,

9124,ULhoofZmZmg,"True. Alibaba is an experience. It gives pride to Chinese that they could get anything at one place. <br>The margin is very thin and by Jack  Ma himself, they took time by volume to make up the numbers. <br>Also he argued,  the charges were low and the customers and suppliers did not mind paying the transaction charges. <br>Finally eBay and  Alibaba are two different concepts. <br>EBay while based it&#39;s model on arguing or bargaining as the base money spinning spree, Alibaba is a trade portal which had it&#39;s own business dynamics.",

At times, people were also cheated into getting wrong delivered products.

9239,B5txS_lC1yY,"I want to quote from Dmart &quot; From the launch of its first store in Powai in 2002, DMart today has a well-established presence in 284 locations across Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, NCR, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Rajasthan. &quot;<br><br><br><br>I can understand your families pain and suffering but your interpretation about 93 does not coincide with the information above, the era of 2002 is way different than 1993.. some of your videos shows over exuberance - &quot; just like any other Indian&quot;. It clearly shows what your agenda is and why do you want that agenda to be portraited. for me a narrative should be close to reality - which your trying hard and i appreciate it.<br><br>To be précises - kirana shops used to give monthly katta and people did not go and buy in Dmart for its pricing and this was a reality. to put petrol in their bikes and scooters for traveling to a place like Dmart were there was no buses during the starting phases of dmart. no one would spend money to go. only the rich classes were target audiences.<br><br>I just want to understand how your getting sponsors - please do a video on that!",
9240,B5txS_lC1yY,Really !!! The chart was of ur family expenses???,
9241,B5txS_lC1yY,There is one more thing to keep in mind. Big multinationals  will not give fast moving items as demanded by kirana stores. THey will give fast moving items and will push slow moving items. ie. If Company X has product a as fast moving item and product b as slow moving. Company will X will give only product a if kirana stores buys product b also. <br>Thus Kirana stores are at dis advantages as their inventory goes up with slow moving items. <br>On the other side Kirana stores also at fault for taking their local customers for granted.,

9261,B5txS_lC1yY,"Your Case study analysis is so Good. I worked in Dmart for 1 year and the topics you&#39;re covered are true without misinformation.  Indeed the dmart offers significant discount by boosting it sales, hence they get more discounts from vendors in regular basis. I would like to add few more points where dmart earns revenue in following areas.<br><br>1) They have private lables which are competitors for high sale product, The dmart either manufacture or market those products and they will be placed those products next to competitive product. ( Ex Mazza- Mango merry, Nescafe - Lecafe, Harpic - Force 10,etc; the products packing are so similar, sometimes even the regular customers can&#39;t differentiate) Since they market/ manufacture this products they are quite cheap compared to the competitive products.<br><br>2) Loose Grocery contributes 23% of daily stores Revenue. Since they obtain the large quantity of Groceries from farmers.( Eliminating the middle men) <br><br>3) Cross Merchandising<br>4) Plastic and glass items are importing from china and rebranding.<br><br><br>Thanks for the wonderful case study Think School, They are so informative..",

But the traffic signals stopped working after it got opened, due to this a lot of accidents started taking place in this area. It is clear that D Mart bribed &quot;someone&quot; to stop this traffic signal so that it will become easier to their customers to take wrong route (if not they have to take a U-turn at next junction which is ~1km).

9421,odiaekxLY0g,"Bajaj finance is the worst company I became a customer of. They issued a credit card to me without my knowledge and after a few years, wanted an annual fee on it. Stupid!!",
9422,odiaekxLY0g,"Bajaj Finserv has been in the market as it comes from legendary Bajaj family,  earning the trust of people.  Then the interest where most of NBFCs charge high,  taking cut from manufacturers worked both ways.<br>That was good thinking. Third as data mining showed the risk profile of customers,  it&#39;s easy to take decision.<br>People wanted hassle free credit and bajaj provided it. <br>As alternative to bank loans,  it is finding the gap in credit market. <br>Where do they get funds as it is known tapping the debt market nationally and financing even in rural areas.  It is to be seen how their rural consumer market penetration is. Also their profit from the revenue is smaller compared to Muthoot finance. Internal efficiency is key to sustain market. <br>Now new forms of credit is rising and let&#39;s see how they manage the competition.",

9427,odiaekxLY0g,"This is a great case study. Thanks :)<br>Quick question: With increase in competition, how is Bajaj gearing up for the next few years? Based on my understanding the advantage they had pre-covid with lot of FOS is lost. With easy 0 EMI options provided by all banks on Amazon/ Flipkart etc, are they losing share?",
9428,odiaekxLY0g,Is CRED coins useful like credit card points???,
9429,odiaekxLY0g,"Is it wrong to put it like this, that by going ahead in this direction although it is creating a healthy environment at one place but similarly leaving behind/creating/magnifying a large vaccum in another place. I also guess over a period of time the vaccum would get so large that it would have to self consume/self destruct itself to balance out the happy/healthy end. Also, after a certain threshold it is no longer just facilitating the needs of target audience but amplifying it thereby amplifying the vaccum too.<br>Kindly share some insight, thanks!<br>Needless to say your channel and content is delightful!<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thinkschool"">#thinkschool</a> @think school",

9504,LYs4b3fTX7Y,See from my side the worst thing this startups are doing is they are giving discounts in the start of their business as they are spending a ton of money to attract new customers by giving them discount and thinking they will leverage from this after sometime but thats not how it should work see what ola was doing they were spending 200 for a ride from which they will earn 150 rs so directly they are making a loss of 50 rupees by giving discounts to rider and incentives to driver as well to attract them to use their app but i think what they should do in begining is  they should just target the people who were using cabs in daily life see if 3 crore people of india were actually using cabs to travel they should have make a target of 50lac people whom they have provided the service hassle free instead instead of giving discount s to them if I am spending 100 rupees daily as a consumer but i having hard tym to travel to office daily i will prefer 110 if a good cab service will pick me up and drop right i will not go for discount istead i will prefer a good service cab right so ola should have targeted those people only instead of hiving discount to everyone and luir them to use ola uber .They should have target the affordable consumer first and earned from them after that they could have grown in a profitable business now the graph is opposite same thing will happen with zomato dunzo all this giants as in this grocery wala business to they do have lower margin than cab servieces they could not get profitaable this way they will just lose investor money😅,

Who thinks themselves as gods...!! <br>&quot;Here we don&#39;t go, there we not want to go, there no return customer available&quot;... <br>Many excuses to cancel ride, but very less dedication to serve...!! <br>So, people kick ola out...!! <br>Simple...!!",

9520,LYs4b3fTX7Y,I don&#39;t understand 1 thing i.e what are the costs that they are incurring in businesses to get losses . Jst taking WhatsApp as a example it jst had 55 employees as far as I  knew it ( if I&#39;m wrong pls excuse me ) because they automated the entire system. And we users are using it as a part of our life every day. Why can&#39;t Uber or Ola automate everything . To the extent I have knowledge they need employees (other than drivers) to <br>1) verify the driver details (can be outsourced)<br>2) Customer support (can be outsourced)<br>3) accounting can be automated to some extent<br>4) Application (software) maintenance i think so even this can be automated completely .<br> If there are any more pls let me know I can gain knowledge...,
9521,LYs4b3fTX7Y,Not good <br>I had a very bad experience in Delhi we book Ola to city walk mall we just sit and she don&#39;t know the way he said he don&#39;t way then left the car he charge us even when we did not go anywhere that is very rude and not fair at all,

9524,LYs4b3fTX7Y,Ola has shitty pricing system where as Uber has better and reasonable prices everytime. In past 1+ year I have never opened Ola app.,
9525,LYs4b3fTX7Y,Ola should have become NBFC giving loans to drivers than becoming battery bike company or used car company,

9530,LYs4b3fTX7Y,"OLA outsourced it&#39;s support to India. So now, when drivers need support, they&#39;re met with Indjuns acting dumb. Keep it up.",
9531,LYs4b3fTX7Y,They have started up a whole automotive industry 😂 he will earn more than ever,
9532,LYs4b3fTX7Y,What about road tax for drivers,
9533,LYs4b3fTX7Y,Rapido ka customer experience bhut achcha hai .wo apne customer ko bhagwan ni manata meko bina matlab ke ola ne block Kiya hua hai .jabki rapido pe maine bhut bar ride cancel kiya hai ek do bar minus Kiya unhone bat Kiya fir tik ho gaya ek bar mere paise extra kat liye bat Kiya mai to return ho gaye,

9537,LYs4b3fTX7Y,Now the OLA driver is taking advantage and charging double off and making so many excuses and something threatening to charge extra amount,
9538,LYs4b3fTX7Y,Then how did ola start a electric scooter company and a electric car company,
9539,LYs4b3fTX7Y,Volume is very low brother,
9540,LYs4b3fTX7Y,All these companies are exploitative to both the cab driver as well as customer. They are nothing but explotitave feudals.,

9542,LYs4b3fTX7Y,I want to add one point. Big metropolitan cities are now having metro facilities which are slightly cheaper than Ola Uber. People are covering distance in half a rate through metro as compare to Ola Uber. People are switching more into facilities which are cheaper and that&#39;s the reason why the big companies are going down day by day.,
9543,LYs4b3fTX7Y,I prefer Uber,
9544,LYs4b3fTX7Y,Well .sir how did you collect this information please can you tell me,
9545,LYs4b3fTX7Y,One of the most unethical company,
9546,LYs4b3fTX7Y,"My memories of being an early adopter of Uber way back in November 2013 refreshed. I left my corporate job in 2017 and working from home since then. I don&#39;t take many rides now but speak regularly to drivers. <br><br>What I did notice off-late is- these apps induce lots of anxiety among drivers. Young men have got BP and sugar-like ailments. This they feel when they move out of the gig economy and work for a regular job.  <br><br>As a society, we need to be conscious of protecting regular paying jobs. Though I like gigs more profitable, that is not the case with those who are easygoing in their life. Just because somebody is easygoing, we must not punish them too harshly. <br><br>This is my general sense. As much as possible, we must educate drivers and delivery boys for making more savings rather than upgrading their lifestyles.  <br><br>Hope this community passes that wisdom to delivery boys now as and when they get an opportunity. <br><br>Thanks.",
9547,LYs4b3fTX7Y,How ola is in loss dude; it costs so much high fares 😂😂,
9548,LYs4b3fTX7Y,"As the number of cab drivers falls, the salaries of the those who continue to stay would stabilize and increase. Ola will stabilize soon in my opinon. However, diversifying into electric vehicles was a bad move.",
9549,LYs4b3fTX7Y,OLA driver  asks customer  to cancel service  after his entry into cab  Comes for same charges for that ride. But later when customer takes ola ride   past cancellation charge is collected I was victim also Avoid ola as much as possible  Why ola drivers are doing this  must be known to its administration  Also ola charges are little costly at some times  Public opinion is not so good  and so it&#39;s business will go down,
9550,LYs4b3fTX7Y,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ola"">#ola</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23olacabs"">#olacabs</a> The Problem is not just for Ola its for many similar Startups, Indians are so used to free things and these startups use the same strategy as politicians gathering votes, but in the long run they are no able to even get back what they gave free! the Ola apps sucks ! drivers demand additional charges and if the customers don&#39;t agree they refuse to take the rides and Ola has no way to help the customer get a ride. there is no way to complain about this. they need to see apps such as didi (in china) the apps are so marvellous and if the driver refuses to pick up the customer or asks for additional cost the customer can immediately complain. the navigation system is very mediocre. The main reason why riders shifted to apps like OLA is for convenience and right pricing. Now it is no more convenient and no more cheap. off people in Ola were so amazing they would have fixed this small issue much earlier. <br><br>Apart from all this the most important issues is the kind of commission these startup are starting to charge. when there is exorbitant profit there will either be exorbitant competition or exorbitant problem. This is the case for all start-ups in India soon Swiggy, zomato, mobile payment services will also have same problems, unless otherwise they change their attitude to giving free and trying to collect it back later.",
9551,LYs4b3fTX7Y,"Hi Ganesh, thanks for your insights. What value proposition do you think apps like driveu give vs the fixed 18,000 per month dedicated driver? Are they sustainable in long term?",
9552,LYs4b3fTX7Y,Cheating poor drivers will not work out for any Cab business.,
9553,LYs4b3fTX7Y,Every party in a business must get profit above their cost price.Otherwise they are just going to create some confusion for some years by destroying business that are genuinely done and then fall themselves.,
9554,LYs4b3fTX7Y,The reason why I stopped using ola is coz after taking a ride i paid the driver whole amount using upi but they kept sending me due amount notifications and didn&#39;t allow me to book cab until i cleared that due amount. I mailed the customer care showing the proof of payment but never got my issue resolved.  And their customer care  number is useless. So I&#39;m left with uber only option.,
9555,LYs4b3fTX7Y,"Fleek, zomato, Amazon, flipkart - problematic companies. Buy direct from the company. Get rid of this discounts. <br><br><br>Irony that this person talks about ola and promotes fleek :P",

Plus the constant ride cancellation fiasco.<br>With the exorbitant taxes in this country on anything and everything, rising fuel prices and rising cost of living, while companies like TCS and Infosys still paying salaries they decided in 2015, no working professional is going to opt for this travel option.<br>Whats sad is that even in this scenario, our finance minister from Centre said the decline in Indian Auto industry is because youth is taking Ola/Uber rather than buying a vehicle.<br><br>The whole scenario is a big circus IMO.",

9650,9SmS3qLe00k,"No matter what or who,we can&#39;t and never can compare ourselves to Japan..it&#39;s a total different country",
9651,9SmS3qLe00k,"TLDR, India cannot learn much from Japan. They are very different countries with different histories, circumstance, and different cultures.<br><br>1.) Japan is Confucian in culture, India is not. Confucius cultures (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, China) are world famous for creating extremely efficient bureaucracies. This is a strength that India cannot replicate, even the West cannot copy this. This is an inherent strength to their way of thinking and their political philosophy. I have literally NEVER seen a Non-East Asian person practice or even engage in the study of Confucianism. The ideas are too foreign and it&#39;s precepts are too strict for outsiders to accept, understand, and least of all appreciate. Like the rest of the world, Indians will NEVER accept Confucianism and thus never benefit from it&#39;s advantage of efficient bureaucracy.<br><br>2.) Japan is a homogenous culture, 99.99% of the Japanese people are not only of one race, but of one ethnicity. India has many different races, ethnicities, and religions. The Japanese speak one single language, when the prime minster of Japan speaks, everyone listens and can understand him; India speaks over 200 languages and dialects, many of which are mutually unintelligible. This fact alone makes communication, cooperation, and logistics in India EXTREMELY difficult. Something Japan never had to deal with.<br><br>3.) Japan was never colonized by the West, India was brutally colonized and exploited by the West for centuries. Thus the historical mentality of the nations are very different. Because of their history, Indians have a victim mentality and a superiority complex. The Japanese do not suffer from these things. The Japanese are confident in their culture and see no benefit in nationalistic pride, political bickering, and/or blaming others for their problems. Have you ever met a Japanese person demanding reparations from the USA for being nuked in WWII? NEVER. The Japanese people are a proud people, their expression of pride is pride in their work and their contributions to their society. It&#39;s not the Western form of pride that is based on a superiority complex which just leads to endless debates and arguments that yield nothing; Of which Indians have unfortunately, adopted.<br><br><br><br>4.) Last but not least, even though Japan was physically destroyed by the end of WWII, it&#39;s people were not. The expertise, engineers, businessmen, and human capital was not. They rebuilt extremely quickly because they still had that thing that is most critical to building an economy: talented Human capital. The same thing happened in Germany. India is FAR behind in human development and will have to invest heavily in developing their human capital for many generations before they can reach what is required to modernize. Rebuilding a country is very easy if you have the human capital to do it. China knows this all too well and invests HEAVILY in developing, maintaining, and keeping their human capital. India falls short on investing in this critical part of their development all the time. The Worst part is India&#39;s system actually encourages their most talented people to move overseas to the West. India needs to stop this and incentivize it&#39;s most talented people to remain in India.<br><br>There is an old saying that goes: &quot;Indians are massively successful everywhere, except in India&quot;. This needs to stop. When young talented Indians can confidently say, &quot;my best chance for success and a better life is in India&quot;, this is when India will become a world power.",
9652,9SmS3qLe00k,"So in conclusion, it is the people and their mindset about a common goal that helped Japan become what it is today. Something like this might never happen in India since majority of the people are not up to this mindset because of our large population. More importantly, the education system in Japan also teaches moral standards which leads to the people becoming better at life while in India morals have very less value in the education system. I am not saying Indians are not good but since India has a huge population majority people can&#39;t become better in our current system and lifestyle. We&#39;re just making more and more people, sending 50% of the smart ones abroad to pay taxes to other countries and keeping 100% of the illiterate one&#39;s at home that don&#39;t even know the worth of life and for sure can&#39;t pay taxes (or don&#39;t want to). Still, hope is everything I believe. Jai Hind.",
9653,9SmS3qLe00k,"He is talking about delayed differentiation in the production process and just in time manufacturing in the car industry to explain why Japan is such an “economic miracle”. It’s 33% of his video but these are minute contributions in the grand scheme of things. They are easy to be copied by other countries. They are not so great like he says. They can not compete with the cheap labor sourcing of other countries. That cheap sourcing will transfer from China to other countries like India and Africa and countries like China and Korea will start to eat away at Japan’s more complex manufacturing industry. Just look at what has happened to Japanese TVs… He does not mention that just 8 or so years ago, Nissan was going bankrupt and needed Carlos Ghosn to bail them out with western style management policies. <br>(Who they then, by the way, manufactured some trumped up charges for him and put him in jail because they didn’t want a foreign company to take over Nissan.) He does not mention all the money received from America and all the changes made by the Americans which caused Japan to flourish. <br><br>japan is NOT a good model. They have no system built to encourage new ideas and new businesses. This is why they could not export their Galapagos phones abroad and is why they failed to export their e-wallet osaifu keitai system abroad and why Apple Pay crushed it. It is also why, despite having their domestic Blockbuster type video rental (Tsutaya), they failed to adapt and Netflix rules streaming video here (in Japan and in the world).<br><br>They are xenophobic. Wages haven’t risen here in 30 years and they won’t let immigrants come in en masse to support the social economic system. They won’t allow foreigners to travel here for such a long time. They have an aging population and the social security system is collapsing. Kyoto is going bankrupt and this is also because they have all their business congested in Tokyo. This coupled with their need to meet face to face to conduct business leads to huge inefficiencies which is why they’re famous for “hard working”. No, they do not work hard, they work LONG. Work smart, is not what they do. This is part of the reason why their suicide rate is so high. People crawling out of their little box homes in Tokyo to go and work 12+ hours a day, most of which is made up of unnecessary meetings, is no way to live a life.",
9654,9SmS3qLe00k,"GARBAGE AND BULLOCKS: I was teaching and researching this subject at a major university at the time of Japan&#39;s rise and fall. This article overlooks the DOWNFALL OF JAPAN in the 1990s, and Japan&#39;s totally different position in the world today. Japan&#39;s economy developed TOTALLY under American supervision and with HUGE American investment after the War, as America viewed an economically successful Japan as a bulwark against Communism. Japan developed under American supervision, and with AMERICAN COOPERATION, and it NEVER took a foreign policy stance against America.<br><br>Now, sadly, Japan&#39;s economy is in a tailspin, and it has been largely eclipsed by China. I don&#39;t think India is prepared to lose a war to America, which worked great for Japan and Germany, nor do I think it is ready to be a stalwart supporter of American policy, as Japan was and is. Perhaps the best lesson India might learn is how to avoid building massive government debt and an overheated economy, which are generally beleived to have been responsible for Japan&#39;s downfall.",

As an American I believe our system which protects against anti-competitive policies doesn’t support Keiretsu models. <br>I am in favor of anti-monopolistic measures despite loss in efficiency because creativity and ingenuity are both promoted from our way of doing business. Then again everything has a trade off. I seek wisdom to know when to use one form of policy over another.,

9687,9SmS3qLe00k,"Good video here. But I just like to point out the fact that, try as we might, India wouldn&#39;t have been able to grow the same way as Japan. Japan&#39;s infrastructure was destroyed but its systems were largely intact. Also, since the Americans took over defence, they didn&#39;t need much of a standing army. In fact, the self-defense force was created mainly out of need since they faced some problems during the Korean War. The efficiency of their systems aside, their alliance with the Americans gave them access to markets they would&#39;ve found hard to tap into on their own. Thus, while the Japanese achieved a good deal, their post-war growth was mainly due to their connections. Despite their cruelty, I would respect imperial Japan to an extent. But their situation is not the same as our situation. This is one thing the policymakers never understood. Far from creating jobs, Indira Gandhi and Nehru increased unemployment by their socialistic tendencies. The mentality of the people back then is another issue. During the British Raj, you could either get a job in some English factory or you could be employed in a government office under either the British administration or the Princes. There were a few industrial houses even back then like the Tatas and Birlas but instead of focusing on helping them grow, create jobs and on creating more such companies, the politicians made people fight over reservations in government jobs. It became a question of different sets of cronies living off the taxpayers as governments changed mainly because we had leaders who only knew how to take and extract, not to enable or create. In addition, we had 2 hostile neighbors and not a few internal issues. Even if we wanted to, we couldn&#39;t have reduced defence spending. In fact, the banks that were nationalized by Indira Gandhi were following a system similar to the Keiretsus and giving loans to the large industrial houses. She nationalized them and pushed them to focus more on agriculture. I can&#39;t say food security had no benefits and this was a move that was welcomed when it was originally rolled out. But of course, it did create long-term problems with enormous defaults and poor industrial growth.  This was the kind of environment that we had to work with. More than 80% of our population was illiterate and could not afford education. There were more factors involved as far as India was and is concerned than just a question of our people&#39;s laziness. In terms of structure and economy, we were a bamboo stick and Japan was a well-forged if broken sword.  Even now, we have only just realized our real potential. We have only just begun developing it. Giving credit where it&#39;s due, developing even to the extent we have is significant given that for every step forward, there was always someone or something wanting to push us 10 steps back.",

9693,9SmS3qLe00k,"One more fact to add: The U.S. and other industrialized nations enjoyed easy access to cheap Middle Eastern oil from 1950 to 1972, but the Arab-Israeli conflict changed that dramatically in 1973. Arab members of the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) protested the West’s support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War by stopping oil shipments to the United States, Japan and Western Europe. OPEC also flexed its new-found economic muscle by quadrupling oil prices, placing a choke-hold on America’s oil-hungry consumers and industries. The embargo had a global impact, sending the U.S. and European economies into recession. As part of his response to the embargo, President Nixon signed a federal law lowering all national highway speed limits to 55 mph The act was intended to force Americans to drive at speeds deemed more fuel-efficient, thereby curbing the U.S. appetite for foreign oil. This way Japanese fuel efficient cars became popular in USA",

9720,3tVoKZ5pHMU,"Because of an inordinate and rigid emphasis on grades, our education system is training students to write and excel at exams. Education always looks to the past in order to preserve the past. It concerns itself with &quot;what was and what is&quot; as against &quot;what could be&quot;. Curiosity,  exploration and creativity ( hallmark of childhood) are systematically killed in schools. Analytical thinking , while necessary, isn&#39;t adequate to address problems in a world that&#39;s changing at unprecedented speed. Our pupils have become competent at breaking down a problem,  identifying chains of cause and effect and describing it. An overwhelming majority of them use word &quot;because&quot; excessively. That&#39;s all there is. No encouragement for asking &quot;why not&quot; as it smacks of rebellion and challenge to status quo. Pity that &quot;why not&quot; has the seeds of creative new ideas. &quot;Because&quot; is descriptive - it cannot lead to new ideas. &quot;Why not&quot; is generative - it leads to new creation. High time we introduced Design from standard 8, as it can train pupils to leave aside the obvious and work toward non-standard, unconventional solutions.",

I have completed my engineering from Computer science background but you know what I really don&#39;t know about my subject.<br>2. I got a cgpa of 8 but  I  don&#39;t know how I get it. I just know that I got a degree that just BE passed.<br>3. In 3rd year 5th sem college placement training, again they are going with very small introduction of DB, C, Java, aptitude to get placement I have sit there to get placement in company. But you know what happens I didn&#39;t sit any placements not any single company. Why because I don&#39;t know what is engineering? That question I asked many times to myself. I have searched for books where I realised  that I am not qualified for engineering.<br>4. You know when I got to know about engineering subjects when I prepared for GATE, then I got real understanding how engineer thinks. <br>5. You are telling right every engineering college is became a business. There aim is to get as many as admission and to make lots of money but not making student to realise his full potential. What students wants to do in life.<br>Atlast your book recommendation is very good, I have covered some books specially &quot;Start with why&quot; .",

9775,3tVoKZ5pHMU,"I don&#39;t know if this exists in other places but there is a system of buying engineering projects in Chennai and Kerala. My father strictly told me to do my own project during the final year of my btech. Me and my project partner being in mechanical engineering made a machine which removes coconut husk, cuts it into two halves, filters and collects the water.<br><br>When we demonstrated the project, it was disheartening to see the guys who bought and couldn&#39;t even explain the project getting the same marks as us. 4th year project is a tool to pump the grades too. I felt that it was a waste of time, effort and money.<br><br>After completing my masters and now completing 5 years of work, I realise that this was the best part of my BTech.<br><br>Education is nothing without application.",

9785,3tVoKZ5pHMU,"In my final year as a mechatronics engineering student in Nigeria, I was very obsessed with solving a problem in agricultural sector through mechatronics application. On a long run, I observed that the engineering system only permits success even on existing project and not failure/success on a new innovative project because the lecturers see themselves from a loser POV and love to see their loser trait in students.<br><br>Thanks for all your sound and educative contents.",

Suppose if a subject has total 10 classes in a sem and u bunked e classes and ur medical is not approved by the college then u will hav to attend the summer class of the subject and pay extra  ₹10,500 for that subject&#39;s class and exam. If u think how any subject hav jst 10 classes in one whole semester then wait. I had lab subject of jst 6 classes and I missed 3 classes due to network issue and other problems but my excuse wasn&#39;t entertained and here I&#39;m without any job paying extra 10,500 plus they also failed ne in 2 subjects which whole university passes by cheating and i failed bcoz i didn&#39;t cheat enough.

9800,OO_t9KhVg0U,Fact is asian needed nice friendship with each other . European American are doing the same.. that&#39;s how they are dominating the world.,
9801,OO_t9KhVg0U,Once upon a Time Tamil Pallavas helped and had good relationship with Chinese But Now they capture Sri Lanka and Threatening the security of Tamizhagam ( Tamil Nadu and Kerala ),
9802,OO_t9KhVg0U,"China having Interest rates on their loans that are higher than the Global standards is a complete lie. If that was the case, why do other countries find Chinese loans more attractive than the Global standards loans🙄🙄🙄",
9803,OO_t9KhVg0U,WION 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,
9804,OO_t9KhVg0U,"So the Chinese radar ship can track rocket and satellite launches.  The US has assests in space that can do that as well.  So how exactly is that killing Indian security?  If India launches 20 nukes at Pakistan, are you afraid the Chinese ship will warn Pakistan?   The ship can sail anywhere in international waters. Why is docking in Srk Lanka a threat to Indian Security?   Up untils a couple of years ago (before Hong Kong demonstrations) US warships would dock in Hong Kong. (and sailors disembark for shore leave).",
9805,OO_t9KhVg0U,China is not the only country in the world but also the us does the same,
9806,OO_t9KhVg0U,This is just India trying to bully sri lanka and crying about china as usual over nothing.<br><br>Can someone tell me why china docking in hambantota is a big deal when china can just sail even closer to indias coast(up to 12 or 22 mile is the law) and there&#39;s nothing India can do? Usa does it all the time with Arleigh Burke warships but china doesn&#39;t. So why does India complain about the ship docking in hambantota? Just to bully sri lanka because they can&#39;t do anything else because china is beating them at everything and India cannot do anything about china directly. And so they take their anger out on their tiny neighbour.,
9807,OO_t9KhVg0U,INVADE IT LIKE RUSSIA DID,

9902,fTuVWwTQegQ,But Zomato is not focusing on cloud kitchen rather it&#39;s focusing on hyperpure more.,
9903,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Unlike copying products, copying food dishes is completely different. Even with the same recipes, the same food can taste very different from place to place.",
9904,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Does anyone else think we are over hyping the data in the long run? <br>cz I think data has this incredible ability to read people better than themselves, so it does help the business.

We should not at least let that happen.",
9905,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Hi, <br><br><br>I am going to highlight a thing at which nobody so far has noticed. It’s about ethical turned unethical practices of a Indian reputed firm so called “Zomato”. The era of food delivery at home started around a decade ago which soon started becoming popular among one an all eventually and now almost is a name on each and everybody’s mouth. Myself, also being a very big foodie started availing Zomato’s delivery service sitting home which was an awesome experience in starting years. Food delivery those days was costing not much expensive. Zomato’s surcharges from their partner restaurant which usually includes commission, tax on commission, and other minor charges which cumulatively summed up t0 17-19 % in till the years of 2019-20. Then pandemic changed everything and spared not business / person however It’s Zomato who fed every needy individual while sitting at home. This model was very much appreciated during those days and it was hugely considered by everyone that Zomato is the future of the outside food but nobody then knew the dark truth to be come in time to come. <br><br>Before all this story I would like to introduce myself briefly. I’m 36 years old individual qualified as a Chemical Engineer with working experience of 10+ years. My last jobs were with reputed companies i.e. JSW group, Toranagallu, Karnataka (Epsilon Carbon) and Tata Chemicals, Mithapur Salt plant (through third party) and my last drawn salary was 9.36 Lakh per annum. After a long span of living a family life in these remote areas and meanwhile pandemic effects on job market made me awake to enter into cloud kitchen business which used to be my passion. I took a huge risk leaving my job aside and started a cloud kitchen after trying for around 8-9 months. I had no lack of passion and was not at all scared of hard work. I was very much confident about my abilities and experience which I assumed will help me grow in the business. Zomato for me then was just you, I or anyone else know about.<br><br>My online food selling business started in May 2022 after documental formalities. Till that date, Zomato’s commission (including everything) officially was rose to 27% which is a lion’s share in profit. When we talk about eateries (restaurants, food stalls, street food stalls, Thelewala), 70% of the business even don’t manage to earn (say take home wages) this much amount to their home (27%). <br><br>Now the story comes to Zomato. <br><br>Earlier we used to go outside physically at restaurant to have our food whenever we wanted to do. Zomato eventually changed the picture and made things easy. Although, people merely experienced when their meal plate became costlier like anything in very short time span. Due to this Zomato’s huge commission restaurants started hiking their price by 30-35% which was substantial amount in this short period. A person who was getting average meal for say i.e. at INR 150 + taxes + delivery charge) which may be approximate INR 175,  he started getting the same food Rs. 250 or even more. <br><br>If restaurant tries to maintain the hiked price to make sale balanced, he falls in great loss. <br><br>27% commission and taxes too just a myth. Restaurant encourages or simply speaking blackmails restaurants to do participate in promotional programmes which are chargeable schemes. It means if restaurants don’t participate in programmes, their visibility on Zomato app will be as poor as that restaurant will hardly get a couple of orders in a day. Now the actual expenditure on Zomato ad comes into picture. They have customized many plans and schemes to be opted by restaurant partners. Big daddys in restaurant business can afford and select high package schemes whereas even a ordinary package is costlier for a common food service provider though no option left but to go with ad scheme. It indirectly adds an additional average 5%  load of 27% discount summing it to 33%. <br><br>The story doesn’t even end here. Unethical practices from Zomato leave the businessmen in no way unturned to earn his bread and butter. Every now and then, Zomato sends a mail to their restaurant partners that they are starting a campaign where restaurant’s visibility will be made higher on Zomato food delivery app for which they have to opt for their scheme in which restaurant has to provide a discount to customer. This discounted amount is completely borne by restaurant however Zomato never highlights the same and takes all the credit of discount by Zomato itself from customers. A dirty reality is that customer always thinks that the discount being offered is by Zomato but not by restaurant. I some case if under-priced food, any complaint is raised by customer which comes in the form of review / ratings which directly affect restaurant’s overall image and rating. However up to this it’s fine but in some cases spam ratings also take place for which Zomato never let restaurant speak directly to customer due to which their probability of making the repeated mistake can be nullified.<br><br>As mentioned above, these promotional campaign sometimes are imposed without authorization of restaurant. Restaurant comes to know on this when a lot of orders are already gone. These discount promos are operated by Zomato itself hence can’t be stopped by self. It takes 2-3 days after your complaint to get the promo offer stopped. Till the same time, you have no other option left with you to do. First is to turning the restaurant off on Zomato (which negatively impacts the image of restaurant on customers) and other is to bear the losses of unauthorized discounts (unwillingly but only to show the restaurant open). Due to policies made by Zomato, if we reject the order in this case, visibility of restaurant becomes so poor that restaurant may not receive new customer orders for couple of days. This thing has been experienced by me 4-5 times in last few months, and subsequently Zomato has not compensated for losses anytime or eben not bothered to revert on raised tickets.<br><br>Next point is that Zomato is so unethical that many restaurant which are getting continuous negative rating however managed to maintain the restaurant rating as 4+ on app. It doesn’t apply for common restaurants who are not capable to pay heft ransom in form of paid ads. Zomato doesn’t share its algorithm methodology (confidential as per Zomato) which they use for restaurant’s overall rating calculation and on the basis of same they are not all bothered to answer your restaurant’s rating improvement. Overall rating on Zomato is a main factor depending upon which the sales is dependant. I tried no stone unturned to improve my retuarant’s rating by getting maximum 5 stars however failed to improve because Zomato is not all bothered to answer.<br><br>Each and every query is raised in form of tickets to Zomato. Its replied with customized and computerized mails and tickets are closed furher. There is no direct telephonic link to talk to Zomato anytime in <a href=""http://need.in/"">need.In</a> this case we feel nothing but helpless. <br><br>8 out of 10 restaurants are being closing every year but now I came to know that 4 of them are deserving but are victims of business based corruption say monopolization / duopolization.<br><br>Surprisingly, there is no proper authority is controlling these firm. This is directly affecting consumers. The days are not far when food will not be in plates. It will be in small bowls. <br><br>The above content is a brief article that I would like to convey to you in hope that it will be highlighted and brought to consumers. The time is not far when Zomato will be a modern franchise version of EAST INDIA COMPANY. I’m already at the verge of closing my kitchen but before that I want to let the reality come in everybody’s knowledge.<br><br>Many more things are there which I’m not highlighting in this short mail.<br><br>Support data on my mails can be produced if any action is likely to be taken from your end.<br><br>Lastly, I would only like to say,<br><br><br>SAVE YOUR PLATE.",
9906,fTuVWwTQegQ,By laying off their employees,
9907,fTuVWwTQegQ,Food delivery is not a profitable business unless someone invents teleporting in the next few years. The razor thin margins is not enough to attract investors interest and the same also means small changes in costs can severely flip a profit making company to a loss making one,
9908,fTuVWwTQegQ,Amazon a sissy cheater,
9909,fTuVWwTQegQ,Excellent,
9910,fTuVWwTQegQ,Abbe chal paka mat,
9911,fTuVWwTQegQ,Where is my gold  😜😜<br> just kidding.... You did your best for knowledge,
9912,fTuVWwTQegQ,I was financial controller of kitopi 😀,
9913,fTuVWwTQegQ,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTuVWwTQegQ&amp;t=8m07s"">8:07</a>. this data is incorrect. These ghost kitchens rely on digital mediums to get orders. CAC and AOV matter a lot, and with competition, maintaining them is impossible. And 1 Lakh rupee is nothing for digital marketing. You can only advertise within certain radius.",
9914,fTuVWwTQegQ,Nope 🤣,
9915,fTuVWwTQegQ,Cow dung,
9916,fTuVWwTQegQ,Good work. Well done.,
9917,fTuVWwTQegQ,Nice information brother 👍,
9918,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Still cant agree... The roads in India are worst, the weather conditions are bad and local food chain sellers got a community... They can easily drown Zomato and Swiggy.",
9919,fTuVWwTQegQ,Normal restaurants and hotels well die and sucide only rich will get more rich,
9920,fTuVWwTQegQ,So it&#39;s worth to buy 1000 shares of zomato,
9921,fTuVWwTQegQ,Never ever trust new unicorn going public. These gold mines have now become coal mines and soon it will land mines. Avoid new age public ipo..,
9922,fTuVWwTQegQ,Our business must be ethical like tatas😤,
9923,fTuVWwTQegQ,"One day I vist behroz kitchen, such disappointment, Newer order again from Behroz.",
9924,fTuVWwTQegQ,"In future cloud kitchen will become the biggest failure system in making money, only traditional run system will make profit, this video is 1 year old, still zomato and swiggy are in big loss and cash burning business.",
9925,fTuVWwTQegQ,Best part I&#39;m getting Zomato ad between Zomato video 😂,
9926,fTuVWwTQegQ,Paid video. Have some ethics you fucking sellouts.,
9927,fTuVWwTQegQ,The concept of cloud kitchen and the customer data and its effective use are the key attributes for the success of an enterprise.,
9928,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Zomato squeezing money from delivery partners and many of partners are under strikes on different states ,tamilnadu Kerala etc ,company needs to cooperate with partners otherwise situation becomes worst",

9930,fTuVWwTQegQ,Bought Zomato shares after watching this video. Now I am bankrupt... From 110 to 40 rupees fall ....,
9931,fTuVWwTQegQ,hyperpure analysis...loved it. God Bless your channel and knowledge,
9932,fTuVWwTQegQ,Government has to come up with appropriate Laws to protect small offline business,
9933,fTuVWwTQegQ,YouTube has a nice sense of humour,
9934,fTuVWwTQegQ,I think zomato loses most of its revenue in relentless advertisement.,
9935,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Even if Zomato YOY accumulate losses and at end go to IBC and declaring bankrupt doesn&#39;t affect deepinder Goyal at all because to setup a Zomato like company is not a big deal, it&#39;s assets are merely 100 crores , liquidation will be of only brand name and value, he can very easily setup another food agreegator model company after its delisting. Because whatever he has to earn he earned when he launched IPO and in Blinkkit acquisition which is friends company.",
9936,fTuVWwTQegQ,Zomato share has now fallen 75%. People see these kind of stupid videos and lose their hard earned money. Respect the market. This guy considers himself the smartest person in the world.,
9937,fTuVWwTQegQ,Today zomato traded @41 rs. FunkU.,
9938,fTuVWwTQegQ,Zomato food chain?,
9939,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Zomato investors in 22 be like, this fooool",
9940,fTuVWwTQegQ,Very good video,
9941,fTuVWwTQegQ,really great details man,
9942,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Alexa launched in 2014, curious to know how it was Alexa compatible in 2013 before Alexa even launched.",
9943,fTuVWwTQegQ,a very naive view into the oldest industry of all times,
9944,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Good explanation, but speak slowly and it is more effective.",
9945,fTuVWwTQegQ,"After charging 28% &amp; forcing vendors 15 to 20% as marketing expenses to push an outlet to go up the list, takes no participation in promos, no accountability in failed deliveries, no investments in delivery vehicles, no salaries to delivery ppl, push vendors to offer massive discounts whereby the vendors are actually making a loss on food cost. They still manage to post a loss of 1500 cr. All the money goes towards corporate rent, massive salaries, business class flights at the cost of the vendors.",
9946,fTuVWwTQegQ,So afterall Zomato was not a gold mine investment.. and nor is this guy&#39;s analysis however coherent the story sounds to be,
9947,fTuVWwTQegQ,Watched many video of yours but this video compelled me to subscribe,
9948,fTuVWwTQegQ,Save local street food... 😋,
9949,fTuVWwTQegQ,Thanks!,
9950,fTuVWwTQegQ,Being a restaurant owner zomato and swiggy not profitable for us in short term or long term <br>Discounting culture and highy commission eats into our margin,
9951,fTuVWwTQegQ,Maast rupaiya chaapa hain aise jhut bolwake IPO k samay. Aise paisa kama kae kya karega re. Logo ko bewaja tuneh aise video karwake lalaj dikhaye IPO k tym. Lalchi log phaas gaye 😅. Acha nhi hain,
9952,fTuVWwTQegQ,This Video Aged Very Well 😂 Zomato is otw to become a Penny Stock soon 😂😂 JK but Zomato has lost more than 100% in value,
9953,fTuVWwTQegQ,Currnetly Zomato 📉,
9954,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Zomato can&#39;t make its own kitchen and sell the same biryani sold by behrus. Coz that biryani sold by the name of behrus and not by name &quot;biryani&quot;. Another thing is the recipe and cheff that makes biryani for behrus <br>Sorry if I spelled the name of biryani brand, coz i don&#39;t actually remember the name",
9955,fTuVWwTQegQ,Swiggy killing Zomato very soon,
9956,fTuVWwTQegQ,I stopped booking in ZOMATO. Because the price are 30 percent more than hotel rates,
9957,fTuVWwTQegQ,Feeling sad for those who watched this video about so called SHITMINE zomato and invested in it ..,
9958,fTuVWwTQegQ,What do you think about zomato investing in blinkit. Will it going to be beneficial?,
9959,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Amazon was also cash rich and profitable by the time they started leveraging data while zomato is still taking up debt for operations . Great content though , the parallels with kitopi was perfect.",
9960,fTuVWwTQegQ,I saw zomato ad before starting this video lol,
9961,fTuVWwTQegQ,My friend the so called &#39;Every single expert and fundamental analyst&#39; that you were taunting is right and &#39;You&#39; are wrong about zomato. More than one year on Zomato is still burning invester cash and just getting worse,
9962,fTuVWwTQegQ,note it down. Zomato is never going to be profitable. Any investor buying stocks watching this shit is down 60% or even more. This video came right before IPO. You r just making fool out of people. Its just the game of valuation. Stock market shows u the reality.,
9963,fTuVWwTQegQ,I so want to believe in the Zomato growth story. For the past few weeks I am up-skilling so that I can contribute to Zomato&#39;s journey. But the very fact that the promoters hold 0% shares makes me feel it as a landmine. Do you have any take on this?,
9964,fTuVWwTQegQ,This is conjecturing- In house brands suck and Bed Bath Beyond is the latest victim to this. We all know these in house products are not the same as brand ones,
9965,fTuVWwTQegQ,Everyone knows how zomato will become profitable except the management of zomato.,
9966,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Maybe it’s not a GOLD MINE. I have lost trust on any of the recent IPOs cause all are just burning money given by VC to increase valuation, go public and dump it all on naive retailers :)",
9967,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Amazon has practically monopoly over ecommerce. Zomato doesn&#39;t over cloud kitchen. Data alone doesn&#39;t makes investment opportunity. Making proper utilisation is. Frankly ordering from Zomato is extremely expensive than ordering directly from the restaurant. With lockdown no longer factor, dining directly at restaurant is better than ordering.",
9968,fTuVWwTQegQ,I look i laugh nkw,
9969,fTuVWwTQegQ,"2 mins silence for those, who believed it 🤣😂",
9970,fTuVWwTQegQ,🤣😂😂,
9971,fTuVWwTQegQ,Will go to single figure,
9972,fTuVWwTQegQ,This did not age well,
9973,fTuVWwTQegQ,This did not age well,
9974,fTuVWwTQegQ,Plot twist - People are going to be most health conscious so they will eat home made food,
9975,fTuVWwTQegQ,"While I agree with you on most points, product and food are not the same. People go to restaurants for the experience as well.",
9976,fTuVWwTQegQ,It is not easy to copy the food compared electronic items..in food people need variety nobody orders from same place every day..everyone needs different food and different brand .even if Zomato copies the food and taste it will be branded as Zomato food not McDonald&#39;s or KFC or any other restaurants,
9977,fTuVWwTQegQ,But the stock prices are saying otherwise,
9978,fTuVWwTQegQ,Rebel foods be like:- ya toh dhandha band karwadega😂,
9979,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Dude, your analysis is absolutely incredible. It&#39;s a gold mine, no pun intended.",
9980,fTuVWwTQegQ,Zomato and Swiggy charges anywhere in the range of 20 to 40% to the restaurant owners...cost ia being passed on to the customer... You can already see there is huge cost difference between the home order and when you visit restaurant... I have already reduced my orders online for two reasons... One it&#39;s expensive to eat at home and you don&#39;t have feeling of restaurant food... Amazon is still not able to make decent ac or tv (see their rating in Amazon itself) forget about indian food quality... We can&#39;t make food homogeneous..,
9981,fTuVWwTQegQ,Thank you man.,
9982,fTuVWwTQegQ,This video shows that you have just bookish knowledge,
9983,fTuVWwTQegQ,you are promoting zomato ipo. you should not do it. it is not ethical,
9984,fTuVWwTQegQ,Here after Zomato acquired Blinkit. This video aged well. 😁 That is why always do your own research.,
9985,fTuVWwTQegQ,Imagine if you own a profitable restaurant or any business for almost 10 years and suddenly the landlord kicks you out and he runs the same business with a different name. <br>Not all have some ethics like Tata.  Some new regulations in this will help a lot of SMEs.,
9986,fTuVWwTQegQ,Dislikes from swigy,
9987,fTuVWwTQegQ,Make a video on zomato vs swiggy,
9988,fTuVWwTQegQ,Waching this video in June 2022...Zomato&#39;s tock price became half compared to last year...,
9989,fTuVWwTQegQ,Garbage,
9990,fTuVWwTQegQ,"That is product and this is food taste matters, I have ordered from almost all the restaurants in my city, brands you have mentioned fasoos and behrooz super suck in taste behrooz actually has the audacity to deliver semi cooked meat!!

10167,wAHSJgIx5wA,"So the thing is to make a great product or service first. Now the crucial point is making a product/service that serves the customers and fulfils their needs. When a product can satisfy a consumer then the producers can relate it to the consumer&#39;s life hence speaking a story that speaks to the customer. This creates a bond and an identity is created. Proving my favourite line, people are the core of the business.",

10202,Rh30CfP7ncA,Because India का बाप Shri Shriman Padmabhushan Bill Gates जी has heavily invested in this energy consuming failed technology so his loyal dogs will enforce it and upon us.,
10203,Rh30CfP7ncA,Through one of your wonderful video I remeber that  Right now China is the superpower country in solar pannel production. When it comes to Hydrogen fuel generation We need solar panel and still we are indirectly  dependant on China for the renewable energy production.  How do we overcome for this solar pannel dependency on China?. If you could explain that it will be very usefull and How India can also be superpower country of Hydrogen energy production just like China superpower of cobalt and solar pannels.,

10207,Rh30CfP7ncA,There is going to be huge water consumption in future.,
10208,Rh30CfP7ncA,As the China with their foresight worked harder in Solar Panels since in 2000 eventhough this industry was in loss still chinese government funded these industries and waivered the taxes and today all we know where they are in solar technology a biggest manufacturer of solar panels and were helping other countries through the financial aid to make an agreement for digging the cobalt mines in Congo during 2008 recession and today rest of the world witnessed the dominance of China in solar panels and lithium so we should also work hard for dominance in future.,
10209,Rh30CfP7ncA,"Dominate?? With hydrogen? That’s not a realistic expectation.<br>I think NG is simply trying to get better utility of resources for Indians.<br><br>Another aspect is the hydrogen filling time. It’s not 8 minutes as you said. It’s a lot longer and the hydrogen gets cold. Which has this issue with fuel pipes freezing shut on to the gas tanks<br>Of course any technical challenges take time. But what I am saying is, it’s not yet mainstream. Hope it does become mainstream soon!!",

All our companies use carbon in the form coking coal to reduce iron ore to iron. There are no commercial plants in the world who uses hydrogen as reducing agent. There are few demonstration projects running like the SSAB in Sweden .,
10216,Rh30CfP7ncA,like your energy. hope India succeed in making the hydrogen a viable solution.,

10281,Rh30CfP7ncA,"Hydrogen as an Alternative Fuel<br>Hydrogen is considered an alternative fuel under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The interest in hydrogen as an alternative transportation fuel stems from its ability to power fuel cells in zero-emission vehicles, its potential for domestic production, and the fuel cell&#39;s fast filling time and high efficiency. In fact, a fuel cell coupled with an electric motor is two to three times more efficient than an internal combustion engine running on gasoline. Hydrogen can also serve as fuel for internal combustion engines. However, unlike FCEVs, these produce tailpipe emissions and are less efficient. Learn more about fuel cells.<br><br>The energy in 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) of hydrogen gas is about the same as the energy in 1 gallon (6.2 pounds, 2.8 kilograms) of gasoline. Because hydrogen has a low volumetric energy density, it is stored onboard a vehicle as a compressed gas to achieve the driving range of conventional vehicles...wikipedia. From 1992 it is on  paper only. We are not really serious.",

10286,Rh30CfP7ncA,Why the hell are our scientific advisory so stupid. It&#39;s been proven that green hydrogen technology is not very energy efficient and is not profitable!! The green investment could be so much better spent with investments in solar panel industry and  wind turbines. Every big player is just trying to cash in on this blunder . What a sad state of affairs,
10287,Rh30CfP7ncA,"<b>History repeating like during WW2 and WW1/Spanish plague.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now under WW3 and a corona virus pandemic. Hitler used Zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the fumant removed.  It causes symptoms like corona virus.  Look up in the sky you will see planes spraying your cities!  Hitler attacked Russia, just like what is happening now.  The British Empire had no legal male Heir so they imported a fake one from Germany.  The British Queen&#39;s husband &quot;Prince Philip&quot; renounced his German citizenship, became a Greek citizen and as a Greek citizen moved to Britain gaining citizenship there.  After gaining citizenship, he was appointed a Duke, out of thin air and then as a Prince and married Queen Elizabeth.  &quot;Prince Philip&quot; took the name of the Queen, not the other way, as it usually is done, where a wife takes the husband&#39;s name.  The British Empire has run out of male Heirs at least twice, and they kill to suppress it.    WW2 was a way of hiding this fraud, and now WW3 is a way of hiding that illegal combines Heir. The Bible says that a male would not fail to sit on the throne.  A family name continues through the males, not the females, and Philip was a fraud.  He had become a Greek citizen to make it appear that he was a Royal from the earlier Greek dynasty.</b>  Total theater.  <b>The Catholic Empires of the Roman Empire form one leg and the UK(British controlled) Empire forms the other leg of the Roman Empire, with the King Pope Francis as the ruler of the whole system.  He has a triple teired crown with 666 on it in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  He is a King of the city state of the Vatican(the Vatican is the smallest Country in the world), Rome Italy, and is mentioned in Revelation, Apocalypse, 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions that this Empire is responsible for all those slaughtered on earth.  It mention what the leaders wear, which is scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  The UK leg Royals also wear those colors, a long with Judges and Magistrates of the Crown.  They refer to this entity as the Crown.  When some one goes to court in one of the British subservient Nations, it is said that the Crown has a case against the person.</b>  Canada, Australian and others are not sovereign or free.  please read Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, and study it closely, because this Empire comes as a false system claiming to represent God, but exterminates to stay in power.  <b>1Timothy3:1-16 mentions that the one looking after a group(Church) should be a husband of one wife with obedient children.  The Pope and the Priests of the Catholic Church are forbidden to marry, and so don&#39;t even qualify, according to the very book and God they say they claim to represent(an unmarried man has no wife or children.)   The Bible&#39;s Peter&#39;s mother in-law was cured by Jesus(Yeshua).  So if Peter had a mother in law, then he had a wife as there is no other way.</b>  That is why Catholic Priest have sex with so many little boys, girls and women attendees.  <b>There was over ninety cases of Preists molesting little boys in the city of Boston, USA alone.  None of the Priests were disciplined, but were only moved to a different location, and now you know why.  The whole system is a fraud.</b>  So this organization has many false teachings.  <b>The Roman Emporer forced a combining of Biblical and Pagan beliefs, when Rome Nationalized the Church.  Rome forbid the celebration of Biblical Holy days and Sabbaths under threat of beatings, then confiscation of property and finally death.   Many beheaded or burned alive.</b>  Revelation Apocalypse 18:4 says get out of this organization &quot;my people&quot; if you don&#39;t want to receive her plagues.  <b>Freedom to communicate is under attack by Church and State, up to the point they are threatening to bomb the microprocessor production facilities.</b>  Pray for me and you, please!  <b>Russia says they have the proof that Britain was involved in at least thres major terror attacks against Russia.</b>  Would Russia bomb their own 5+ Billion pipeline, their own bridge, powerplants and Navel yards?  <b>NATO said that they would attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize their island, because Australia would feel threatened, but NATO was militarizing Ukraine, where they had bunkers full of weapons.  NATO&#39;s puppet regime in Ukraine was banning the Russian language and culture even though that was many people&#39;s only language.  The Ukrainian Capital is a Russian word until Western media changed it to hide the Russian history, as Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a recent NATO coup, which the US planned, as they told their dignitaries not to attend the Russian Olympics at that time. You could go to prison for teaching the Russian language. All opposition parties in Ukraine (banned).  Those with out blue arm bands(now yellow?) being put to death.</b>  Many US Officials had been talking about a coming war with Russia and China.  Years in advance.  <b>Donald J Trump said he couldn&#39;t answer corona virus questions claiming we are at war.</b>  Trump said that the US will soon be at war with Russia and China. <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, but are part of China, as acknowledged by most nations of the world till recently.</b>  NATO is planning to do to Taiwan and China what they did to Ukraine and Russia.  <b>Britain fighting for Democracy in Ukraine?  Britain has had two or three Prime Ministers that have not been ellected, trying to help the naked Emporer.</b>  Think!  <b>Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband&#39;s attack is a fraud.  The Police changed and contradicted the events multiple times and it makes no sense.</b>  Corona virus is a code name for information that exposes the crown(Government/Royals).  A vaccine is computer/electronic device program that deletes information from your view(anti virus software).  Symptoms for a biological virus comes from being gased, radiated or sprayed in your environment.  <b>Planes fly in parallel patterns, causing heating of your environment and breathing difficulties.  Like Hitler killed by Zyklon B gas, so now they use a deadly gas in incubators.</b>  Donald J Trump said he would put Hilary R Clinton in prison when ellected for starting a war and genocide in Libya, but when he got in power did nothing.  Americans have started many unjust wars.  <b>America/NATO is about to start wars with Ethiopia, Haiti, Taiwan, Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the list goes on.  NATO Countries have invaded more than half of all sovereign Nations on earth, in the last 30 years.</b>  When you print money on paper and then go buy things with it, and it is not backed by any thing then you have to attack a lot of people to keep the scheme going.  <b>New Central Bank digital currencies(CBDCs) will be centralized and backed only by cow farts and trust, where as Bitcoin is decentralized and backed by gold.  Bitcoin/gold and silver came under a major attack by the crown(governments).  The digital currencies will create a M.O.B. type system, that if you get in government cross hairs you will be shut out of the system just like Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Russia and so on and so on.  If they do it to a complete Country, then they will have no problem doing it to individuals.  Canada confiscated people&#39;s money breaking international law.</b>  Rome enters a Country, exterminates, and keeps the remaining people&#39;s in refugee camps called Reserves.  Periodically they thin out the population.  They usually make a lot of noise about sport team names with Native names and how people are trying to erase their names, so as to hide the real erasure of actual peoples.  <b>Revelation 7:9, God says he would take out of all Nations and Tribes and Peoples a people for himself.  God accepts all those who accept him of all Nationalities.</b>  Donald J Trump started operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American people by military nurses.  Trump added death by electrocution, firing squad, poison gas to the already used lethal injection.   <b>Trump foretold war on Russia and China years in advance, a said no one would protect the Pope more than him.</b>  America turned it&#39;s back on God, so now he is turning his back on you.  <b>The US, Canada, Germany, Italy, Britain, Australia, Austria, Ukraine and many other Nations refused to agree and voted against a move at the United Nations to condemn Nazism.  Russia voted against Nazism.  Remember the Nazis?  They started WW2 and exterminated 12000000 human beings, often by extremely cruel means.  The Ukraine military has a entire Nazi battalion the Azov Nazi battalion.  Church leaders clearly seen in Hitler&#39;s Nazi SS footage blessing the troops before slaughters.  The Azov Steel Works was full of Nazis that surrendered to Russia, with pictures confirming their Nazi swastikas tattooed on their bodies.</b>  Ukraine banned all opposition parties and is trying to exterminate the Russian language, people and culture.  Teachers are sent to prison for teaching the Russian language in areas where most only speak Russian.  <b>Fighting for Democracy?</b>  Britain installed two Prime Ministers that were not elected.  <b>Donald J Trump used his office while President to start a business so called &quot;Truth Social&quot; that he claimed would enable free speech.  Later Mr.Trump tried to get the Justice department to stop late night hosts from talking about him.  So supposedly creating free speech over here, but attacking free speech over there.</b>  Russia and China no longer accept US fiat currency, so G7 banned Russian gold. Supposed unbiased media not allowing comments, is a mass deception and contrary to their purpose. CBDCs attacking crypto. 1933 the US confiscated gold.   For 50 years, 10 years in prison for having it, and only ended when gold was separated from backing money in 1971 now backed by cow farts. 2022 Biden bans Russian gold.  Military wearing US/UK flags in Ukraine. UK/Rome&#39;s &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;² ;+&#39;-&#39;&quot;",

Of course they received a lot of negative criticism for the conditions of the imported labor used for construction, but most of those people were able to earn some money that they would not have gotten in their home country.

At the same time, Dubai had enough oil reserves to distribute, contribute to the welfare of the 70k people and build infrastructure. Meanwhile, a city like Mumbai gets a much more expensive bill for social infrastructure maintenance and the majority of the city&#39;s income still comes from taxes. <br>Policy and strategy is extremely complex and multifaceted; many things become clearer in hindsight.",

You please approach Kerala with an open mind-without political bias, Kerala is surely a model. Especially for states with fragile economy. They Can learn a lot from Kerala how to deal with poverty / maintain democracy in  micro level, / Universal education with all modern amenities/fine System of healthcare right from Panchayats to Medical Colleges etc etc. Here we don&#39;t have any freebies. Only pension of Rs.1600 PM to aged people having no other Income. Even Congress or BJP never Say Pension is disbursed on political line ie only to party members No.. It is very transparent and eligibility is verified and scrutinised by ward level Peoples body- Jana Sabha - consisting of all party members. Since Kerala is higly populated and there is scarcity of Cultivable land Kerala Can&#39;t be governed by north Indian models. here Most of the families (consisting four members) own 3 to 10 Cents of land only. Nobody can own more than 15 acres. Can a N. Indian think of that. ? So Kerala is different from other part of India and hence it had to evolve its own system of Policies and governance. If you travel from South- Thiruvananthapuram to North-Kasaragod (560 KM ) you may think this state is a large metropolitan City. Not an inch of land without house/Shop. So only left leaning Policies and Interventions Can  Save Kerala. Please learn Kerala Independantly. Every Indian State Can emulate our de- Centralisation and peoples planning. These two helped us much to develop even our most interior/remote village. 3 o - 40% of total budget is allocated to Panchayaths. they decide how to Spend where to spend this money. Can you suppose in any other state where food packets Supply uninterreptedly during Covid Period. ? Not a Single man including millions of workers/daily labourers Coming from N. India faced hungry during those days. The best way to know about Kerala is your own brethren Who works and reside in Kerala. They are lakhs and lakhs. Many of the Poor employees from U P Bihar Bengal never want to return to their home state-because they feel they enjoy - what is security freedom Secularism absense of Jati / Caste. they are the best Source to learn about Kerala Thank you",

10733,yPo7mq27jEg,Well explained with facts. Populistic and free bees will ruin financials of India. There is need to create revenue than draining revenue to get power.,
10734,yPo7mq27jEg,"your presentation is great. Whatever govt does is dissastor and any govt scheme is loot. Unless govt also implements hire and fire for non performance what we save in pension scheme is lost and gone, though not in Rupees by calculation but by errosion of value of rupee drastically by high inflation and printing of notes.   For example I saved in PF 8 percent of my salary with 8 percent employee contribution for 30 long years..Now interest on that you got to day Rs 9000  which is taxed and actual value of of corpus is erorded by minimum 500 percent. Adaniis,Ambanis,Sighanias ,mallyas ,etc who are working on govt projects with our corpus funds  and with govt clout are billionaires and not employees even with 8 percent set aside.What you save for to morrow it is loot for corrupt and frauds ,  what you get is Peanuts  considering i hv contributed 8 percent of my earrning for 30 years . Please do not sugar coat and make any money  as subsidy given to poor and needy out of tax as sin.  This money belongs to public and from higher taxes paid by haves.T his is capitalistic propoganda by govt. Govt wants money to splurge and loot  with its financiers of its party. When man is starving to day you show him to morrow and take away his earnings. SUBSIDY TO HAVE NOTS BY TAXING HAVES IS NOT SIN. LET GOVT EFFCIENTLY COLLECT TAXES WITHOUT CORRUPTION . LET THEM SEND CORRUPT GOVT OFFICIAJLS TO GALLOWS . EVERYTHING WILL BE ALRIGHT",

Also our ministers in their 5 year term make money not only for their immediate family but for their children and grandchildren, aunts and uncles live a luxurious life.  Collectively it is huge amounts. Another point is the pension scheme of ex-MLAs after their 5 year term, is continued which many people want it stopped.  Also government staff, many say, that they are already earning good salaries then why the need of pension?  So many peoples views and opinions are there on the net.

Absolutely amazing work.<br>There&#39;s one more factor that led Tata Motors onto capturing Market Share, In India we do have a debate of price sensitive over life sensitive, however there&#39;s one more debate when an investment into Passenger car comes into play and that is the Engine, Maruti&#39;s announcement of discontinuing the diesel engine has been a game changer for Tata Motors. We all believe in Indian Products, the build , the quality of Tata Motors have been up to the mark all this years, but there was something more which led this movement which favoured the likes of Tata Motors.",
10942,WP0X1R_z7yI,Tata has the shittiest gruff unreliable engines in the Market. Only a person who doesn&#39;t know what refinement and reliability means would buy a Tata. Rip,

10952,WP0X1R_z7yI,I have an Altroz and a Harrier. Both the cars are great but the sales experience and after sales service suck big time. I bought these cars only for the emotional attachment to the name of Ratan Tata and the NCAP 5* rating. Tata definitely needs to upskill it&#39;s service teams big time.,

10959,WP0X1R_z7yI,Small correction. Mini is owned by BMW. Not VW.,
10960,WP0X1R_z7yI,"Tata vehicle&#39;s build quality and performance is awesome now. But the service is worst, which is a real concern for the customers. I own a nexon and its been 1.5 year and i&#39;m fed up with the service centre&#39;s unprofessional+ irresponsible attitude and service. This u will experience when u have any issue that needs expertise or warranty replacement required. Also i think plastic part&#39;s quality needs to be improved. Till i had such an experience i believed in performance, comfort and build quality. But after my service experience i learned service is much as important as whatever i had valued about a vehicle till that time. Worst service = unwanted mental stress, money waste, time waste. Out of 10 customers, who go for service,  7-8 people will get annoyed by the service. Even in waiting room other customers talks about their experience and issues after service. And these service centre guys are not all changing even after complaining to tata motors itself. One service centre guy told me like technicians and executives are not staying there for long, they will find another job after working sometime in these service centre&#39;s, so they mostly dont care. I  personally dont have any hope that their service will be better in any near future.on last service they told my vehicle&#39;s right door&#39;s wiring set needs to be replaced under warranty after 2-3 visits . Now its be 1.5 months, whenever i call them they tells me like part is not available. Will give a callback once it is available. The experience is from tata malayalam service centre kochi.",

Tata really need to look at premium models development.,  it is not easy.. but why not, if Mahindra can make , why tata cannot make .. it is really amaze, no big sale model from tata btw 15 to 30lckas price range, Safari is there, but not very famous compare to other models.. mostly toyota, mhendram, suzuki occupy that space... we leave above 50lckas cars . that needs lot of money spending .. but I think 20 to 30 lack range cars can design like Innova , Scorpio, fortuner ...",

11006,FxiZRYJTEo0,"so basically, China learnt absolutely nothing from 2008 housing crisis of USA. Gotcha.<br>This video leaves out a big part - why these crisis actually happen.<br>Just like in USA, in china also, the problem starts with increased borrowing of the state. In USA it is because they want to do wars all over the world. In case of China it is because of their insane &quot;civilian&quot; projects all over the continent. Yes OBOR, CPEC that nonsense.<br>Now when this starts to happen, the value of the currency starts to depreciate. Then country increases fed rates which causes recession - EXCEPT in secotrs shielded from foreign competition. Which in most countries is real estate. So while everything is regulating itself to fed rates, this bubble keeps growing until it bursts taking everything with it. That is what happened with USA and what is happened with CHina here. This crisis is also the reason most of CHina&#39;s international projects have not been completed either.<br><br>This is also precisely why we keep talking about resolving NPA&#39;s in India. Before this we had Mallya, now Adani Ambani. When will the world learn? Look USA is already trying to put in the CHIP act to combat Chinese shortage. They wont be successful because it would be just too <a href=""http://expensive.to/"">expensive.to</a> manufacture there. What we need to be careful of is the foreign investment bubble.

11028,FxiZRYJTEo0,"Gold maybe worthless except as a safe investment....but the catchword is &quot;safe&quot;. As long as people crave gold, the resources sunk into obtaining the metal can be recuperated, i.e, the investor does not lose the value irrespective of the usability of the metal. <br><br>With real estate in China, there are two points that you could have covered to give a bit more context:<br>a) There is no private property in China. Home owning implies the right to live/sell/lease the home for a period fixed by CCP (which is ~75 years right now). So, they NEVER own the asset fully...they only hold the rights to it for a fixed duration<br>b) Home prices are based on perceived value in the future based on demand rather than actual value. So will the demand for these houses exist when (and if) the Chinese population halves from the current number in 2050 (as forecasted)?<br><br>So relatively, obsession with a worthless metal like gold might come out as unscathed over an artificial inflated housing price bubble. <br><br>Completely agree with the perils of the FD mentality in India.

11053,FxiZRYJTEo0,Ho will it affect Indian economy?,
11054,FxiZRYJTEo0,"One thing that I have noticed in all videos discussing China is that home buying is a mindless Social norm of China.<br><br>Its not a mindless social norm. Literally anything you want to get done here, you need Hukou for it. And Hukou is household registration booklet that you get when you buy property. If you dont buy property, its your parents Hukou that will be used and your parents may not have lived in cities.<br>Let me give you an example. If you want to send your kids to school, the only school the kids can attend is the one that is linked to their Hukou. As we all know that schools differ in the quality of education so if you want to send your kid to a good school, it is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL you buy property near that school. Without having a Hukuo near a school means your kid will never be able to attend it. <br>Secondly, this system suits the government, as not only does it allow the government to monitor their citizen movements (As if you live on rent somewhere for example, you need to be registered with the police) but it also brought the government a lot of revenue. By giving these lands to lease to these big developers. Infact it constituted 70% of the provincial revenues in some provinces and led to conflict of interest and losening of controls on construction.<br>There is another factor here. Unlike in democratic nations where popularity of the leader determines who rules, competence determines who rules or maintains rule in China. And one major way of demonstrating competence and getting promoted within the party is when you demonstrating high GDP growth as a ruler of a district or Municipality or City or province in China. And what better way to demonstrate GDP growth than by using construction? Bringing back to point 1 of this video.<br>There are deeper structural issues in how the system of China is set up that resulted in this crisis. But one thing you all indians and other youtubers making doomsday videos on China&#39;s economy need to understand. China is not shrinking. This video is weeks old and China still stands. Is peaceful, protests are no longer happening and things are under control. Situation is being fixed and it will be fixed. China is far stronger and more stable than what you give it credit for.",

11056,FxiZRYJTEo0,Great job bro,
11057,FxiZRYJTEo0,I believe the property bubble is also brewing up in India. I have a friend who is a builder in Vadodara (a small town of Gujarat) and he said there are between 5k to 10k homes vacant and I am talking about a small town here. These homes are bought with an investment purpose. I myself visited a few communities in this town and I got a feeling of a ghost town already. I hope people buying property in India for investment purposes realize this bitter fact soon and stay away from it.,

In this case Evergrande has taken money from banks to fund too many ongoing projects and in turn borrowed raw material from a huge set of vendors. So if these builds are GHOST BUILDINGS and they are not occupied/sold on time, it will lead to one more similar situation what happened in 2008 right. Given the focus on China, there are lot of international banks and other companies which have heavily invested and still investing.",

I was buying Zara womenswear extensively as they were very affordable, I can afford more items and the bright colours of the outfits while most of the other fashion retailers were playing safe with blue, grey, black, white, beige etc. I personally believe it&#39;s Zara who changed that and Brough more confidence to women when they were dressed in bold and bright colours and make them stand out from the crowd. Though the quality of their items are medium I still have a handful of items that have lasted over 5 years and still in a great condition. I have changed my strategy now. I&#39;ve reduced the number of items I buy and being very selective as well. I now mix and match Zara items with better quality and pricier pieces of clothing so it doesn&#39;t look like from Zara.",

Please stop this we need this New education policy 2020. I suffered from education system and I just want my future generation for creativity to be encouraged among them. Many argue that we have CEO like sundar pichai satya nadella but again Remember again they are just workers again and they can be replaced. Please revamp the engineering curriculum too dear central govt. And teachers is a big mess of india. Teaching is considered as a low lying job and it&#39;s only unemployed engineers are being recruited as teachers. See in 2018 ctet only 1.5 percent cleared exam it was revamped.

11233,cWsxSP3KGvs,YES.  NEP is a very good step towards progress though it is not perfect.,
11234,cWsxSP3KGvs,"A flaw  (in my opinion)  I want to adress about the current education policy is related to the completion of notebooks of every subject just for the sake of it . During exam time , this becomes hectic as all the students have to make sure they prepare well for the exams . But not a lot of us get to do that since we have this burden of completing never ending notebook work .<br>Sometimes it feels like we&#39;re not even studying to learn something . Because our teachers will hand out all these questions and worlkload tends to get a lot since a part of the portion of the syllabus is rushed during the last week before exams actually start .<br>There seems to be no benfit in just brainlessly copying questions and answers . It&#39;s not just me but my fellow classmates too who I&#39;ve seen spend hours on completing the same .<br>The completion of this notebook thing is damaging and time consuming for us students .",

11264,cWsxSP3KGvs,"But most students don&#39;t know why they are studying English, Hindi, Maths, Science, and Social Science. Learning with zero application is an absolute waste of 17 or 18 years of schooling. It is the problem! Blaming the &quot;education system&quot; is just a silly excuse! No education system will ever be perfect. Let&#39;s get over it and do something practical or go extinct in a thousand years. The choice is clear, I suppose. 😆😆😆",

11266,cWsxSP3KGvs,♥️this video has so much value to it. <br>tq,
11267,cWsxSP3KGvs,We need to be optimistic and pessimistic at the same time to actually be able to come up with solutions to the problems in the education system and rectify mistakes. I disagree with you on choosing either optimism or pessimism. Both are required.,
11268,cWsxSP3KGvs,"I have done masters in mechanical engineering. The saddest part is that after MTech, my only 2 gateways were either to join a Research lab as an associate or to get into lecturing. The only way to upscale my career option later was to do a phd, yet have no industrial exposure. <br>You are right, a person who teaches engineering students himself/herself is unemployable.",
11269,cWsxSP3KGvs,These changes are required since so long. Good the current government is taking this and hope the transition happens fast.,
11270,cWsxSP3KGvs,I appreciate your analysis . As a teacher I consider myself good but the even the college education where I teach is designed by University which has no practical applications. So why blame the British . They taught us English which has made us relevant in many countries. Blame the government which sat ducks  on an education system with no direction or vision. The teacher has no say in matters here as to what must be taught and how. We must look at the positives not negatives. The real question is how long are we taking to design our curriculum to s relavant model and how. This applies a cross every aspect of our education. No teacher participation in curriculum formation and mo broad vision. It&#39;s time we realize science and arts are not wo tight compartments. Google was designed by the tech and an artist after all.,

11272,cWsxSP3KGvs,Only children born with good IQ make  it to the mark &amp; become Sundar Pichais ..but majority don&#39;t because of Indian education policy based on Orthodox British education system which was meant to produce  only office clerks.  <br>So when will Indian education policy produce a million sundar Pichais ? <br><br>First thing the NEP should enforce is that no Home-work should be forced on children because of which children spend hours  just  to copy paste &amp;  somehow submit the homework &amp;  after school hours let&#39;s say  if there is  homework even for just  6 subjects then a student spends minimum 6  to 9 hours in just writing &amp; filling pages  of  book  without reading or understanding the subject matter &amp; this is the reason most students are not sucucesfull in the later part of their life . and then we say when will India have a Microsoft or a Tesla or a Google.  India does not have a Elon musk or a Bill gates etc because  Indian education encouragees Mug-up culture and are producing crores  &amp; crores of  non thinkers who may pass university  exams but miserably fail  in competative entrance exams.  Why? Because Indian education only suits or is meant for children born with good or high IQ but what about the rest.  ?<br><br>Moreover since the student spends  many hours in  just  filling pages without reading the subject as the student does not get time plus because the student spends all his or her after  school-hours  time in non productive homework so the student does not get time to play or engage in extra circular activities.<br> So as a nation what kind of youth are we producing . As a nation India is producing non-productive..non physically fit youth who cannot compete  &amp; such a non competative youth population  start  taking  short cuts and so compromise on merrit &amp; so India has become a nation of non meritorious population &amp;  how can such a indian society  of non-meritorious   citizens    create a positive &amp; secure future for India.   This vicious cycle which is the DNA of the current  Indian education system must be broken to produce not a few sundar Pichais or Satya nadellas  but India needs a million sundar pichais..&amp; satya nadellas &amp; Vishwanathan  anand  else India will be a slave nation dependent on other nations just  to survive but not to prosper.,

11277,cWsxSP3KGvs,"this is my scepticism towards the new education policy. the target of this policy on gross enrollment ratio in higher education is 50% whereas the present national average is 25<br>the highest score in this category is Tamil Nadu in the largest States which is already more than aspirational target of this policy. But the present new education policy is  contradictory to the goal of gross enrollment ratio in many ways. to improve the gross enrollment affordability and accessibility to the education is must which is curtailed by this policy and badly affect the poor people. of course to improve the nation  this kind of policy is essential but it should not marginalise the rights of poor people, so it should not be applied universally. the centre and states which has poor gross enrollment ratio would look deeper into the Tamil Nadu model to get benefited.",

This then leads to a fixed old poor mindset of the teacher, and then most teachers believe that they&#39;re above all the students of the class and close their minds to anything new. <br>As the time would pass even if the curriculum would be updated, still the students would have a pulling back effect from the teachers.

11296,cWsxSP3KGvs,India needs education revolution.  Just end exam oriented approach and other things will fall in place. New education policy really looks game changer. excited,
11297,cWsxSP3KGvs,"A totally wrong analysis. Absolutely rubbish. This video is just a summary of various WhatsApp messages.<br>For example, the opinion that schools are designed to function like factories to find manpower for the factories is fundamentally incorrect. Obviously this channel has NO f**king insight into the fundamentals of pedagogy.<br>Indians have this thing where they blame all the evils of their education system on Macaulay. Can there be a more narcissistic behaviour??!!<br>Now, coming to the NEP, it is an eyewash. There are NO revolutionary or even distinguishing features of the new NEP. Let me elaborate...<br>First, the date of compliance for complete implementation of the NEP is 2040. Get that??!! 20 years. A policy that will be fully implemented only after 20 years, is a failure in whatever it plans to achieve.<br>&quot;PhD professors cannot teach&quot; is the gem regurgitated by the speaker. This sensational claim is NOT from any formal study. It&#39;s just his impression. And it&#39;s wrong on so many levels.<br>The NEP has focused on making &quot;coding&quot; an essential subject from grade 9 onwards. Coding was relevant in 2000-2010. That&#39;s when all the major companies of today came into existence. It&#39;s foolhardy to even assume that the same environment will exist in 2040 and that coding is relevant for the future world. The most stupid decision ever taken in education policy.<br>Also, there is NO attempt in the NEP to reduce the burden on today&#39;s students, make educational institutions more accountable, give more power to the students and their parents or to prepare the students for a world of 20 years from today.<br>There is no revamp of the curriculum except stupid exclusions of Muslim rulers from some texts.<br>There is NO integration of either the industry or the society with the education system, which BTW existed in the traditional gurukul systems.<br>In all, the NEP is the biggest eyewash lemon sold to the Indian populous in the form of redeeming set of changes. There is nothing of substance and shows the inability of Indians to properly upgrade their future generations.<br>To the people running this channel, I am starting to get the impression that your a mouthpiece for the ruling government. In any case, your biased, uninformed take on this and several other issues is doing a great disservice to the nation.<br>I know that you have to earn a living and have to have a job. But doing so by sacrificing future generations is NOT the way to go. If you do these things because you honestly believe in them, then your beyond redemption.<br>All I can say is, please do proper research before churning out filth like this on your channel. If India is to survive, then we HAVE to recognise &amp; accept our shortcomings and take action accordingly.<br>And we don&#39;t have a lot of time. The next 10 years make or break this country.<br>The first step to solve any problem is to admit that there is one.",
11298,cWsxSP3KGvs,So true about teachers..Specially the Phd once...Literally they know nothing about teaching ...,

11308,tgFEFEOisAI,Chalan 👍👍🙏🙏🙏🇳🇵,
11309,tgFEFEOisAI,the problem is that bcoz of Russia&#39;s attack in Ukraine the world or so called bad communist people know that America and other Giants will think twice on counter attcking with their own forces... as a latter it just time and Cooperation with this countries will be needed but again as America&#39;s grip on UAE is starting to lose this is the most terrifying future that will unfold,
11310,tgFEFEOisAI,"<b>History repeating like during WW2 and WW1/Spanish plague.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now under WW3 and a corona virus pandemic. Hitler used Zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the fumant removed.  It causes symptoms like corona virus.  Look up in the sky you will see planes spraying your cities!  Hitler attacked Russia, just like what is happening now.  The British Empire had no legal male Heir so they imported a fake one from Germany.  The British Queen&#39;s husband &quot;Prince Philip&quot; renounced his German citizenship, became a Greek citizen and as a Greek citizen moved to Britain gaining citizenship there.  After gaining citizenship, he was appointed a Duke, out of thin air and then as a Prince and married Queen Elizabeth.  &quot;Prince Philip&quot; took the name of the Queen, not the other way, as it usually is done, where a wife takes the husband&#39;s name.  The British Empire has run out of male Heirs at least twice, and they kill to suppress it.    WW2 was a way of hiding this fraud, and now WW3 is a way of hiding that illegal combines Heir. The Bible says that a male would not fail to sit on the throne.  A family name continues through the males, not the females, and Philip was a fraud.  He had become a Greek citizen to make it appear that he was a Royal from the earlier Greek dynasty.</b>  Total theater.  <b>The Catholic Empires of the Roman Empire form one leg and the UK(British controlled) Empire forms the other leg of the Roman Empire, with the King Pope Francis as the ruler of the whole system.  He has a triple teired crown with 666 on it in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  He is a King of the city state of the Vatican(the Vatican is the smallest Country in the world), Rome Italy, and is mentioned in Revelation, Apocalypse, 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions that this Empire is responsible for all those slaughtered on earth.  It mention what the leaders wear, which is scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  The UK leg Royals also wear those colors, a long with Judges and Magistrates of the Crown.  They refer to this entity as the Crown.  When some one goes to court in one of the British subservient Nations, it is said that the Crown has a case against the person.</b>  Canada, Australian and others are not sovereign or free.  please read Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, and study it closely, because this Empire comes as a false system claiming to represent God, but exterminates to stay in power.  <b>1Timothy3:1-16 mentions that the one looking after a group(Church) should be a husband of one wife with obedient children.  The Pope and the Priests of the Catholic Church are forbidden to marry, and so don&#39;t even qualify, according to the very book and God they say they claim to represent(an unmarried man has no wife or children.)   The Bible&#39;s Peter&#39;s mother in-law was cured by Jesus(Yeshua).  So if Peter had a mother in law, then he had a wife as there is no other way.</b>  That is why Catholic Priest have sex with so many little boys, girls and women attendees.  <b>There was over ninety cases of Preists molesting little boys in the city of Boston, USA alone.  None of the Priests were disciplined, but were only moved to a different location, and now you know why.  The whole system is a fraud.</b>  So this organization has many false teachings.  <b>The Roman Emporer forced a combining of Biblical and Pagan beliefs, when Rome Nationalized the Church.  Rome forbid the celebration of Biblical Holy days and Sabbaths under threat of beatings, then confiscation of property and finally death.   Many beheaded or burned alive.</b>  Revelation Apocalypse 18:4 says get out of this organization &quot;my people&quot; if you don&#39;t want to receive her plagues.  <b>Freedom to communicate is under attack by Church and State, up to the point they are threatening to bomb the microprocessor production facilities.</b>  Pray for me and you, please!  <b>Russia says they have the proof that Britain was involved in at least thres major terror attacks against Russia.</b>  Would Russia bomb their own 5+ Billion pipeline, their own bridge, powerplants and Navel yards?  <b>NATO said that they would attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize their island, because Australia would feel threatened, but NATO was militarizing Ukraine, where they had bunkers full of weapons.  NATO&#39;s puppet regime in Ukraine was banning the Russian language and culture even though that was many people&#39;s only language.  The Ukrainian Capital is a Russian word until Western media changed it to hide the Russian history, as Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a recent NATO coup, which the US planned, as they told their dignitaries not to attend the Russian Olympics at that time. You could go to prison for teaching the Russian language. All opposition parties in Ukraine (banned).  Those with out blue arm bands(now yellow?) being put to death.</b>  Many US Officials had been talking about a coming war with Russia and China.  Years in advance.  <b>Donald J Trump said he couldn&#39;t answer corona virus questions claiming we are at war.</b>  Trump said that the US will soon be at war with Russia and China. <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, but are part of China, as acknowledged by most nations of the world till recently.</b>  NATO is planning to do to Taiwan and China what they did to Ukraine and Russia.  <b>Britain fighting for Democracy in Ukraine?  Britain has had two or three Prime Ministers that have not been ellected, trying to help the naked Emporer.</b>  Think!  <b>Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband&#39;s attack is a fraud.  The Police changed and contradicted the events multiple times and it makes no sense.</b>  Corona virus is a code name for information that exposes the crown(Government/Royals).  A vaccine is computer/electronic device program that deletes information from your view(anti virus software).  Symptoms for a biological virus comes from being gased, radiated or sprayed in your environment.  <b>Planes fly in parallel patterns, causing heating of your environment and breathing difficulties.  Like Hitler killed by Zyklon B gas, so now they use a deadly gas in incubators.</b>  Donald J Trump said he would put Hilary R Clinton in prison when ellected for starting a war and genocide in Libya, but when he got in power did nothing.  Americans have started many unjust wars.  <b>America/NATO is about to start wars with Ethiopia, Haiti, Taiwan, Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the list goes on.  NATO Countries have invaded more than half of all sovereign Nations on earth, in the last 30 years.</b>  When you print money on paper and then go buy things with it, and it is not backed by any thing then you have to attack a lot of people to keep the scheme going.  <b>New Central Bank digital currencies(CBDCs) will be centralized and backed only by cow farts and trust, where as Bitcoin is decentralized and backed by gold.  Bitcoin/gold and silver came under a major attack by the crown(governments).  The digital currencies will create a M.O.B. type system, that if you get in government cross hairs you will be shut out of the system just like Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Russia and so on and so on.  If they do it to a complete Country, then they will have no problem doing it to individuals.  Canada confiscated people&#39;s money breaking international law.</b>  Rome enters a Country, exterminates, and keeps the remaining people&#39;s in refugee camps called Reserves.  Periodically they thin out the population.  They usually make a lot of noise about sport team names with Native names and how people are trying to erase their names, so as to hide the real erasure of actual peoples.  <b>Revelation 7:9, God says he would take out of all Nations and Tribes and Peoples a people for himself.  God accepts all those who accept him of all Nationalities.</b>  Donald J Trump started operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American people by military nurses.  Trump added death by electrocution, firing squad, poison gas to the already used lethal injection.   <b>Trump foretold war on Russia and China years in advance, a said no one would protect the Pope more than him.</b>  America turned it&#39;s back on God, so now he is turning his back on you.  <b>The US, Canada, Germany, Italy, Britain, Australia, Austria, Ukraine and many other Nations refused to agree and voted against a move at the United Nations to condemn Nazism.  Russia voted against Nazism.  Remember the Nazis?  They started WW2 and exterminated 12000000 human beings, often by extremely cruel means.  The Ukraine military has a entire Nazi battalion the Azov Nazi battalion.  Church leaders clearly seen in Hitler&#39;s Nazi SS footage blessing the troops before slaughters.  The Azov Steel Works was full of Nazis that surrendered to Russia, with pictures confirming their Nazi swastikas tattooed on their bodies.</b>  Ukraine banned all opposition parties and is trying to exterminate the Russian language, people and culture.  Teachers are sent to prison for teaching the Russian language in areas where most only speak Russian.  <b>Fighting for Democracy?</b>  Britain installed two Prime Ministers that were not elected.  <b>Donald J Trump used his office while President to start a business so called &quot;Truth Social&quot; that he claimed would enable free speech.  Later Mr.Trump tried to get the Justice department to stop late night hosts from talking about him.  So supposedly creating free speech over here, but attacking free speech over there.</b>  Russia and China no longer accept US fiat currency, so G7 banned Russian gold. Supposed unbiased media not allowing comments, is a mass deception and contrary to their purpose. CBDCs attacking crypto. 1933 the US confiscated gold.   For 50 years, 10 years in prison for having it, and only ended when gold was separated from backing money in 1971 now backed by cow farts. 2022 Biden bans Russian gold.  Military wearing US/UK flags in Ukraine. UK/Rome&#39;s &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;² ;!+(!; <b>Roman</b> Catholic Joe",

Countries are invaded, ethnic tribes are infiltrated by the Han majority, languages and script systems are forcefully replaced. This is the true history of China, and will always be. The sooner people, states, countries and ethnic tribes will learn this, the better for them. The whole world is waiting for a better, more human China and foreign policy example.

11391,tgFEFEOisAI,China are simply not prepared for war. They have 0 war experience. America have gone to war in the last 20 years with almost every country in Africa and the middle east.

The biggest flaw is &quot;grossly overvalued English&quot;. No doubt that English is important But food is important as well and yet people diet. There is nothing that has unlimited value, there is a limit to everything. Can any successful person say that English is his(or her) primary skill?

11511,HFzSK32G4OU,Nice thumbnail,
11512,HFzSK32G4OU,"Usually, I like your content but this one has a lot of conjecture. <br>YouTube &amp; YouTube Music are two different apps altogether. YouTube may help you to redirect from a video to its audio platform but that music app still takes up a very very small portion of the market share as compared to Spotify.<br>It wouldn&#39;t matter therefore even if podcasts come under the same umbrella since it is immensely difficult to move a user loyalty from one music app to another unless there is a drastic difference in the offerings.<br><br>They might just end up coexisting.",

11530,HFzSK32G4OU,Good case study. Apple music is available for Android also. Nothing is free with Apple.,
11531,HFzSK32G4OU,"YouTube Premium is way better, we gets YouTube ad-free, background play and picture-in-picture playing along with YT music premium. Both at the cost of one Spotify subscription. Also suggestions and recommendations for music on YT music is as same as Spotify.",

11533,HFzSK32G4OU,"I&#39;m a DJ i have used almost all music streaming platform, music apps, music softwares etc.<br>Spotify is best platform. It pays less agree but other platforms too pay less. <br>That&#39;s why music streaming is not a guaranteed income source for Musicians.",
11534,HFzSK32G4OU,Youtube has some exclusive collection of music available nowhere else. I have the premium subscription of Youtube and I watch most of this channel&#39;s videos as a podcast by switching off the screen.,
11535,HFzSK32G4OU,That&#39;s why they collabed with Netflix to make the Shows and Movies Albums Spotify exclusive!<br>Just like Apple is doing with Apple TV+ contents on Apple Music,

11540,HFzSK32G4OU,why don&#39;t you talk in hindi?,
11541,HFzSK32G4OU,I would prefer Spotify over Youtube Music because of the quality of ads. Sometimes there are 10 min long ads. There is not background playing ability. It just feels so bad.,

11551,HFzSK32G4OU,Good video. I think it would have been nice to mention how many billion dollars Apple made in iPods,
11552,HFzSK32G4OU,Whole Spotify-Joe Rogan fiasco and Apple Music engaging in a bit of trolling would make for a great part 2 in coming months we just don&#39;t know whats gonna happen currently maybe if some big artist pulls their music it&#39;ll be very interesting nonetheless.,
11553,HFzSK32G4OU,Great,
11554,HFzSK32G4OU,"The comparison between Apple music and other music apps is wrong and illogical. Apple music is strictly only for Apple users and rest all apps are for every user. <br>By a far margin, Apple music is the best music app in the world currently in terms of audio output and quality! Apple music is cheaper than Spotify and many other apps but provides best quality audio among all other apps.",
11555,HFzSK32G4OU,"There&#39;s a big issue you did not even touch, and that is yes Napster did change consumer behaviour but the wide scale change was with YouTube.

11588,HFzSK32G4OU,sean parker       (The social network)<br>mark zuckerberg,
11589,HFzSK32G4OU,Thumbnail gives impression that she is recording her fart.,
11590,HFzSK32G4OU,Spotify app is much better then YT music.. music streaming is smooth (it doesnt buffer) and the app is user-friendly..<br><br>YT music interface have lot of bugs specially when ur music get paused due to call intruption and also the playlist of YT music is very weak.<br><br>overall even spotify support is far better then yt music..,
11591,HFzSK32G4OU,you got one thing wrong. apple music can be used without having to buy any apple product. shows poor research from your side.,
11592,HFzSK32G4OU,Only here because of Taylor Swift 🤞❤,

11594,HFzSK32G4OU,Poster are good,
11595,HFzSK32G4OU,Apple never killed iTunes Store. You can still purchase music via iTunes.,
11596,HFzSK32G4OU,Something very important you missed out is the audio quality and audio bandwidth that these streaming services provide. <br><br>Spotify rocks in bandwidth and quality of the songs. <br><br>YouTube music is the worst amongst all.,
11597,HFzSK32G4OU,"Keeping thumbnail in mind, I need to admit that Taylor Swift is a killer cute and hot combination.",
11598,HFzSK32G4OU,Not him keeping taylor swift to attract swifties ❤😂🥲,

Whenever I use my credit card, I pay immediately from my bank account so I don&#39;t have to remember making card payment and also get 2 to 3% cashback every month. Direct cash back is much better than earning points. With points you are trapped into buying something.",

Moreover, I think this BNPL gives a small allounce like 2-8k (Amazon and Flipkart pay later services) will prepare youth to handle credit cards when they&#39;re eligible, it&#39;s not like giving them 30k credit while being unemployed.",
11718,LwnApD9YXNY,The big question is how do these companies handle the loan defaults??,
11719,LwnApD9YXNY,This was your first video which actually felt shit man. For some reason in your quest not to make rbi look silly you decided to say that people don’t deserve credit. That’s for the consumer and company to decide. Not rbi or you. <br><br>The fact that people are not using it responsibly and need to do that is an awareness or regulatory problem. Not one where this product it self should be retired.,

I always pay on time and it has been super beneficial to me since they doesn&#39;t charge me <br>even 1% of interests",

11735,LwnApD9YXNY,the problem is that people who are irresponsible will screw up a regular credit card too.,
11736,LwnApD9YXNY,I use Cred from last 2 years. The best option for emergency loans as interest rate is very low &amp; it is credited into your account in less than 2 mins.,
11737,LwnApD9YXNY,DO NOT get Slice card!! The 3 months interest free option is no longer available! And they charge 36% interest after one month!,
11738,LwnApD9YXNY,Debit card is the best. It keeps us middle class in check and reality.,

11753,LwnApD9YXNY,Great bro ❣️ thanks,
11754,LwnApD9YXNY,Most of the time the BNPL service provider call you before your due date and remind about the payment and is the person doesn&#39;t pay even after that then screw him and yea your should use the service cautiously as to how much you earn and how much you spend and always pay on time but just because of the negligence and irresponsible people out there the service should not be stopped. Their are many who are really in need of it. Cheers,
11755,LwnApD9YXNY,"What I have learnt from using Slice is that you&#39;ll have a thought that you can buy anything you want because you have slice. However, the more you use it, the more easier it becomes to buy stuff you do not need. However, i somehow managed to pull back the spendings. Also, I always stay at least one month ahead in my payments because of how my salary is credited on 10th instead of 1st and the Slice payment due date is 5th of every month. I really love slice. However, so need to be careful of how we use it because it can be very dangerous if used irresponsibility.",

11767,LwnApD9YXNY,CRED is same as Skoda ka LAURA,
11768,LwnApD9YXNY,How CRED makes money? 😀😀,
11769,LwnApD9YXNY,"CRED sponsored this video 🤣 hence the anti BNPL proganda.  <br>Like credit cards, BNPL requires financial maturity. You see the average American drowning in debt when credit advanced is large. BNPL must limit itself to under $100-150 per customer.",
11770,LwnApD9YXNY,"I have a question, as a credit card issuance it is completely dependent on some external income plus multiple factors. Are they equally damaging as BNPL services, if we say that these services are now easily offered to people below 25 or the same customer who were BNPL consumer as that of BNPL services?",
11771,LwnApD9YXNY,Indian education system really needs a subject related to tax and finance. The amount of financial illiteracy we have is astonishing. Even the majority of millennial and gen Z have very poor financial literacy. I&#39;m 23 and when i tell my friends how important it is to manage your finance and investments..they just be like mehhh and burn through their salary with zero savings.💀 <br><br>People really need to learn the difference between &quot;wants&quot; and &quot;needs&quot;.<br><br>Try to achieve your goals without being in debt unless you have no choice.,
11772,LwnApD9YXNY,Now slice is charging if you split your credit. It started from July. Notice came on june,
11773,LwnApD9YXNY,"No matter what payment method one uses, if it is &#39;unnecessary purchase to please unnecessary people&#39;, it will put you into trouble.. Good one 👍",
11774,LwnApD9YXNY,BNPL is unsustainable habit. it must be regulated.,
11775,LwnApD9YXNY,"I got lot of calls for overdraft, loans, credit from Citi banks with lot of benefits, <br>Warning high risk of 15% overdrafts, loan with changing and hidden policies, market strategies. When deep down more for an hour lot of risks involved.<br>Don&#39;t fall prey just reject it.",
11776,LwnApD9YXNY,"what will be the effects on postpe , can anyone elaborate? please",
11777,LwnApD9YXNY,What is need forecredit card.which.has.bad reputation.<br>Why this sudden spurt of interest.<br>Is it economics or corporate strategy.,
11778,LwnApD9YXNY,👍👍👍,
11779,LwnApD9YXNY,All of these criticisms apply to credit cards as well lol,
11780,LwnApD9YXNY,I used cred more than 1 year and now dint use cred bcoz they didn&#39;t settle repayment instantly.....and also it dint give cashback nowdays,
11781,LwnApD9YXNY,Dept is always a trap waiting to spring. This is what a responsible federal reserve looks like. Exploiting people who can’t afford from overspending on ridiculous items(non roti kaprda makaan),
11782,LwnApD9YXNY,Dept is always a trap waiting to be sprung,
11783,LwnApD9YXNY,"The FinTech world clearly knows that Millions of people have poor or no knowledge of Finance, personal or otherwise.<br>Easy Money is the Easiest Trap to setup.<br>Companies want consumers. And they are rarely, if ever, ethical. <br>BNPL takes advantage of this Greed which exists at both the ends of a transaction.<br>Financial management is one of the most critical skills to learn in today&#39;s world.",
11784,LwnApD9YXNY,"This man is trying to trap you people, with his sugar coated fabricated ornamental language, please don’t get trapped. The debt trap is such that once you are in <br>Getting out it will be suicidal. You can starve but don’t take loan from financial institutions.",
11785,LwnApD9YXNY,The video is not as informative ! And stretches too long,
11786,LwnApD9YXNY,UNI still offers BNPL but you can only split for 2 months,
11787,LwnApD9YXNY,Nice but <br>Me and my father both tried UNI card he got it and i don&#39;t <br>CBIL MATTER<br>PLUS TRANSACTION HISTORY.,
11788,LwnApD9YXNY,"RBI should also impose BNPL on the sector of House Loans or Plot Loans with Minimum Limit INR 20 Lacs and Max Limit INR 5 Crs Specially for Serviced Personnels (both private &amp; Govt Sect) because after all who needs Personal Loans with Minimum Limit and higher Interest Rates. Nowadays everybody wants a secured life which ultimately is the Requirement of House/Homes.<br>And remove all those heavy documentations, service payments, etc, etc.<br>There are people who will earnestly and honestly pay back the loan by any means or anyhow",

11793,LwnApD9YXNY,Despite a good video subject. A sponsorship from cred says it all.,
11794,LwnApD9YXNY,"Companies like slice and Uni should undertake a three pronged strategy to create a win-win scenario<br><br>1) Start generating credit scores for the no credit segment to legitimize their credit worthiness, some pushback will come from firms like Equifax and CIBIL but then it is the quickest to market who wins  <br><br>2) Once a legitimized credit score is available, collaborate with banks by sharing with them the credit score as well as providing them a credit worthy future users which the banks can keep in pipeline and use for future revenue projections by signing a contract stating the consumer&#39;s first loan over a threshold value will be from this bank. <br><br>In case the consumer doesn&#39;t comply then they will have to pay a penalty - You can easily track this now from their PAN<br><br><br>3) You give the consumer today 50% of the penalty fee as customer acqusition cost<br><br>By doing this, they would have <br><br>Increased the size of economy and accelerated financial inclusion<br>Incentivized good credit behaviour<br>Generated accurate data for credit scoring companies and banks<br>Made markets less asymmetrical for these banks<br>Made an aspirational INDIA",
11795,LwnApD9YXNY,WRONG - Slice doesn&#39;t offer this no interest for three months scheme any more &amp; moreover they didn&#39;t inform the users about it,
11796,LwnApD9YXNY,I didn&#39;t even know there was credit given through prepaid cards,
11797,LwnApD9YXNY,Rice bran oil.,
11798,LwnApD9YXNY,"BNPL is designed for those garib people who want to buy non required materialistic things to show off in front of brainless people. Credit card is also one of them. I am happy because finally i have closed all my credit cards and now 60% of my salary that is 81,000 rs goes straight as savings and investments, and remaining 54,000 rs is used for the basic residential and living expenses. I am a happy person now. Take my advise say no to all credit platforms.",
11799,LwnApD9YXNY,Government is intentionally pushing people into slavery for life. Modi is ridiculous for economy.,

11899,3rHfD9IB-24,One of my favourite YouTube channel. Thank you sharing such insights with us,
11900,sZmNdXZjKgs,"It is very interesting to see many videos saying UPI is free while not talking about hidden taxes in place of MDR. Remember all merchant transactions still have some type of GST associated with them some as high as 18%.  Since merchants for larger stores cannot assume VISA/MC cards won&#39;t come from tourists, in order to keep things even, they add the MDR costs of all card services to the base price ahead of time. So when we say 0% MDR due to RuPay or UPI, that saving of 2-3% actually goes to the merchant as extra income. In any case, customer is paying the MDR out of their pocket whether the payment platform is UPI or VISA/MC network.",
11901,sZmNdXZjKgs,Don&#39;t we still need our card details to use UPI   ? 🤨,
11902,sZmNdXZjKgs,However in Houston we use a Debit card. The  card is linked to my Security Card (Social Security is our retirement Card.,
11903,sZmNdXZjKgs,Nice info.... Happy to pay same with UPI😁,
11904,sZmNdXZjKgs,In 2021-22 I would have done only 20-30  transactions in cash.Otherwise all rest is done by UPI.,
11905,sZmNdXZjKgs,"If govt imposes zero MDR on credit card people will get more credit card, they will spend more and this may cause  inflation",
11906,sZmNdXZjKgs,Thanks!,
11907,sZmNdXZjKgs,excellent inciative by goverment. should implement it...and link upi with credit and debit card...,
11908,sZmNdXZjKgs,I don&#39;t even my  atm. <br>Just maintaining phone💥💥💥.<br>Revolution 🙂🙂,
11909,sZmNdXZjKgs,Again this guy is one sided. Government will kill Visa and MasterCard. Then UPI can change nominal fees. Due to transaction volume it will be a win win situation,
11910,sZmNdXZjKgs,I remember UPA government introduce the rupay debit cards avoid chergs from other countries cards like Visa Mastercard etc in that time banks replace the cards with rupay debit cards.. after 2014 govt changed.. Rupay debit cards replaced with Visa Mastercard cards...in earlier days if we needs ATM card go to the bank pay 250 rupees apply for card.. now banks directly send Visa Mastercard ATM cards without our permission and amount debited from account automatically.... What&#39;s your opinion on it,
11911,sZmNdXZjKgs,You are beautiful bhawa!,
11912,sZmNdXZjKgs,"I took a pnb rupay credit card watching these videos, finally found out no general UPI accepting shops support credit card based UPI payment... Absolutely useless...",
11913,sZmNdXZjKgs,No shops are taking UPI payment through credit card...,
11914,sZmNdXZjKgs,"At the end of the day someone paying or bearing the cost for this technology. If it’s government then it’s tax payers money, if it’s the bank or payment partners then it is the merchant which means the public since the cost is included already.",
11915,sZmNdXZjKgs,background music is irretating,

11921,sZmNdXZjKgs,"You know it&#39;s hard to look at the big picture when it comes to India. Everywhere you go there&#39;s mostly just crowd and chaos. It&#39;s when videos like these summarise things so wonderfully, you can see what an incredible turn around our country has made within 75 years of Independence. The generation born right before 1947 is very much alive at this point and gets to witness India&#39;s days of post Independence poverty and struggle to becoming a direct competitor to the west. Oh how the turntables",

11927,sZmNdXZjKgs,Excellent step by Indian Government. They should extend UPI to other countries too.,
11928,sZmNdXZjKgs,"The coolest part is Govt is not nationalizing the payment market. They are creating 100x superior product. Kinda like what Uber did to Taxis. One more amazing part to observe is that currently credit cards are only held by the &#39;rich&#39; but if you make MDR == 0 &amp; predatory credit card practices are removed, the market will expand. You&#39;ll have way more people switching to credit cards. Then as he wonderfully put credit cards would become micro-financing.",

11931,sZmNdXZjKgs,"Exactly the point, advance payments and credit taking facilities is what needed for middle and lower middle class and only government can do this<br>Financial inclusion for credit is needed for small and weak strata of population. People pay monstrous interests on lending to local moneylenders who are practically goons compared to credit card interest rates charged by loans, this could be a very big game changer for India",
11932,sZmNdXZjKgs,Credit card owner believe in buying liabilities that&#39;s why there transaction value is much more than debit card owner because debit card owner believe in buying assets not liabilities..... 😂,
11933,sZmNdXZjKgs,As we all see for decades  visa is a safe process ....<br>But is this gonna be a safe process nd if there are large amount of frauds how much burden government gonna take ????<br>Or is it initially came upon user or tax payers..like we see in pnb frauds ..,
11934,sZmNdXZjKgs,Is it just me or did he actually say &#39;GARMENT&#39; of India like a 100 times ?,

11937,sZmNdXZjKgs,Because of UPI i forgot my netbanking passworr 😃😃,
11938,sZmNdXZjKgs,🇮🇳❤️ I closed all of my Visa Mastercard and jumped to Rupay Ncmc card.,
11939,sZmNdXZjKgs,3percent charge for transfer is definitely too much for Indian middle and lower class.maybe the government giving the charge to more local companies similar to visa and master card would cost less or be no charge as Indian lower and middle class can&#39;t afford 3 percent,
11940,sZmNdXZjKgs,I guess you might hv missed NACH/ACH  approval in the flow diagram ?,

11944,sZmNdXZjKgs,You&#39;re the best youtuber from India. Not exaggeration. The best.,
11945,sZmNdXZjKgs,Lmao these sanghi clowns and their fantasies 🤣🤣🤣,
11946,sZmNdXZjKgs,One point I want to add is that where amount of spending is more people tend to use credit cards even if they have balance in sb account to take advantage of credit period while balance in sb keeps earning interest till due date of payment of credit card bill. That&#39;s what I do. As such you can&#39;t classify users as rich or poor based on card usage. I also want to state that within GCC countries it&#39;s compulsory that the transactions are carried out on GCC payment gateway. If the transaction is outside GCC then only visa or master card come into picture. Similarly government can make use of Rupay gateway compulsory for all domestic transactions. Note: That doesn&#39;t mean I am a rich man.,
11947,sZmNdXZjKgs,What is MDR? You did not explain that :(,

11951,sZmNdXZjKgs,"Excellent content as always - 2 thoughts for your consideration. <br>1st: I typically spend greater than 50000 / month on CC and don’t use DC (I use my SB while making UPI payments) so that I can use that money for my Equity Investments. I haven’t defaulted ever on CC payments. So being rich and poor doesn’t necessarily link to usage of CC and DC. I have family / friends who don’t want the hassle of remembering CC payment schedules etc and chose DB. <br>2nd: Although I don’t care if Visa and MC loose business, because I believe with our strong systems we can survive without them, what if Government only allows charging Interchange Fee only and absorbs Switching Fee, would the concerns get addressed? Thoughts?",

11953,sZmNdXZjKgs,Big fan of your videos! Amazing content.,
11954,sZmNdXZjKgs,"Two contradictions from my side,<br>1. Even with current setup the credit risks are borne by the banks and not by Visa or Mastercard. So, no new risk need to be taken by UPI by enabling credit payments <br>2. Whether low or premium payments, government can now stop siphoning of funds in the name of MDR by Visa/Mastercard and also comes with huge leverage if a low MDR is charged by Govt. UPI can be made as huge profitable program ..",
11955,sZmNdXZjKgs,"I told my friend one year back Indian has powerful system of UPI can sell this technology to other countries to the world and gain value and cross boarder payment easily. Now, india moving in that way.",
11956,sZmNdXZjKgs,India dominates the world in UPI. if other countries demand indias upi. Indian currency will rule over the world,
11957,sZmNdXZjKgs,🤑,
11958,sZmNdXZjKgs,"Dude VISA doesn’t take credit risk.  Transaction fees has nothing to do with credit risk.  Credit risk is borne by the issuing bank and it makes it up by charging you higher interest rate if u don’t make ur monthly <a href=""http://payment.credit/"">payment.credit</a> cards are very highly profitable business. vISA is a network monopoly intermediary and they can be only be replaced by such an  entity like govt of India",
11959,sZmNdXZjKgs,Digital revolution is transforming India. All thanks to Jio. Why nobody is speaking that??,
11960,sZmNdXZjKgs,The less money VISA and Mastercard makes the better,

11962,sZmNdXZjKgs,You are awesome bro,
11963,sZmNdXZjKgs,"Thanks for the nice information. One point to your analysis, those who own both credit and debit cards, having capability to pay money instantly, still prefer to use the credit cards. This could be a reason we are seeing high credit card transactions over debit card transactions.",
11964,sZmNdXZjKgs,Really amazing. <br>Could the Think School Team also come up with archaeological case studies of Mahabharata and Ramayana which would make our roots stronger and better. A Suggestion from my side please.,
11965,sZmNdXZjKgs,stop with sound backwound!!!!,
11966,sZmNdXZjKgs,"What the hell? Since rupay is the instrument to compete with visa and MC, they should just eliminate switching fee while leaving interchange fee on its own. That way you don&#39;t infringe on something you don&#39;t control. Govt doesn&#39;t need to compensate for losses incurred by issuing bank. UPI is just a mode/ network",

11977,sZmNdXZjKgs,No MDR means no Rewards or credit points and no offers or extra benefits from credit card companies.,
11978,sZmNdXZjKgs,Here comes the master stroke of charging for every transaction. This will be the end/decline of UPI.,
11979,sZmNdXZjKgs,Rupay is &#39;Rupee Payment&#39;. It&#39;s controlled by National Payments Corporation of India,
11980,sZmNdXZjKgs,Excellent,

11985,sZmNdXZjKgs,Raghu Ram Rajan and &#39;Virus&#39; Acharya in RBI and Economic Adviser Ar&#39;Wind&#39; Subramanian spoke only about beef FOE and such other nonsensical issues where as the current Governor is doing phenomenal reforms in our financial services.,
11986,sZmNdXZjKgs,"Keep doing these Videos they are Informative, Insightful and Awesome. 💌🤟",
11987,sZmNdXZjKgs,Credit card comes with the credit limit set by the bank. And bank would do its credit risk assessment before giving the revolving credit limit. So I am not sure how you are saying that adding a fee will reduce the credit risk. And secondly the credit transaction market being that larger the merchant are loosing money paying the mdr. Last but not the least using a credit card gives you insurance against fraud. Where in debit card do not have that insurance protection.,

12161,Wf6X-50OQdE,"was Netaji also responsible for the Brits leaving Sri lanka, Palestine Israel, and a major part of Northern Africa in period from 1947 to 1960. The US, portugese , france, all left the colonies because of netaji or it was all part of decolnization process. <br>He was no super man military leader who was to defeat to the British India army of the Allied offensive, the INA was moslty an irregular milita with little or no war expertise this was ww2 not some random skirmish.  <br>A regiment of women may sound inspiring but only a fool would use them in direct battle in 1940s.<br>Coming to naval mutiny andRed fort trials, the revolts primarily started because of bad reparations paid to the navy post the war for multitude of reasons. And the mass mobilization was done by guess who? the CPI and Congress (under Aruna Asif ali) the same lot who u are sublty trying to point is reponsible for &quot;hiding&quot; these facts. There is also a memorial in Colaba, Mumbai buiilt to honor this mutiny.<br>It was the Congress defence committe who defended the trio having Nehru and Aruna ali.  All this is well documented and taught at Universtiy level, school textbooks have to fit 150 yrs of history in less than 150 pages.<br>History as other subjects requires people to study at certain depth to understand its aspects, its far more complex than a mere heresay quote (of which there is absolutely no record) of Mr. Attlee",
12162,Wf6X-50OQdE,Jai Hind,
12163,Wf6X-50OQdE,INA was actually created by another freedom fighter Rasbehari Bose. Leter he make Netaji the Commender of INA.,

12174,Wf6X-50OQdE,"When I am a kid, I am not that into history lessons, but when ever I read abt satyagrah lead by Ghandhi, what impact would it make,  I mean to britishers. What will they loose. They said he united India. But many tried to and only he succeeded,  did British let him succeed? Because no ruthless idiot will give away their toys because we asked nicely. I mean they are ruthless, even my kid brain can deduce it, and they certainly not idiots. They manged to divide Indian ppl on bases of many things in just few decades, whereas we lived harmoniously for many centuries. Then came our 10th social teacher who used to get triggered when ever Ghamdhi topic comes. Some times he would burst and scold him straight every saying he is the reason the independence was delayed.<br><br>Later when we learn all these studies, I mean how gullible we have to be or how smart Ghandhi and britishers had to be to fool an entire nation of thinking we got independence because of non violence movement lead by Ghandhi.🤐",
12175,Wf6X-50OQdE,"Bit disappointed, you just shied off calling a spade a spade. It is no brainer who mis-represented/concealed the facts. Would have been better if you had clearly stated that. But still, good to see you raised the INA members were denied formal recognition, whereas your peers count this step as a foundation of Indian Army&#39;s discipline.",

I would like to watch an episode on why and how a lie about his death was spread out and what proved that he was alive till 1985.<br><br>I have read in the book that Gandhiji very well knew that he was alive and not dead , however he was declared dead because everyone in congress knew that his popularity would easily surpass that of Gandhiji .",

Also read various books about Japanese Emperor Hirohito and how he was on a mission to create Greater Asia comprising of &quot;Asian looking people&quot;. <br><br>Subhash Chandra Bose is one of my favorite freedom fighters. However Japanese Army was interested in capturing only North East India as it fit their plan of Greater Asia. Also Naga soldiers who fought the Japanese fondly recall how happy they were to defeat them who left a trail of destruction in Burma and Manipur. This is not surprising as Japanese soldiers were so  brainwashed by Hirohito that this was their trademark style wherever they conquered.<br>If Japanese had won instead, North East India wouldn&#39;t be part of India. And they were not interested in attacking British in mainland India like Bose ji wanted.",

12238,BxDmbGFABJw,one on Dmart pls,
12239,BxDmbGFABJw,it sounds same like d mart in India 🇮🇳,
12240,BxDmbGFABJw,I worked in Walmart for a while in Canada. Another important point is employee growth is unlimited. Most of the people here worked for over 30 years which is uncommon in North America. Some one who started as a sales floor associate retired as a store manager and even as a Zonal head.,
12241,BxDmbGFABJw,D-mart....i hate it!...why u ask?..cuz most of their own products are made in china and i hate it...,
12242,BxDmbGFABJw,Fantastic 😍,
12243,BxDmbGFABJw,"one of the reasons walmart succeed was its location selection. In not so highly populated areas in which it could dominate the location , creating an unattractive market for competing stores. Hence creating a barrier to entry.",
12244,BxDmbGFABJw,"...and in the process, 1. Sam killed a lot of mom &amp; pop stores in the US. 2. They became the biggest importers from China killing all the manufacturers in the US.",

12252,BxDmbGFABJw,"Walmart has become the butt of jokes. Your third point of Walmart being a haven to work is like hearing the Clintons where in fact not a family of career criminals, it&#39;s quite jarring because all I hear is Walmart sucks and the people there are lazy, very flippant and unmotivated. Shopping at Walmart is still cheap but so does buying in Costco. In fact with Costco, I hear good things like real savings passed down to customers, enthusiastic and motivated work force and a better shopping experience overall that does not leave you feeling tedious.",
12253,BxDmbGFABJw,It is always good to listen to you and the way you narrate it sounds simple and good to listen (I know it is not simple or easy ) lot of hard work and  data collection goes in hats off,
12254,BxDmbGFABJw,"Hi Ganeah thanks for wonderful analysis am a regular user of your analysis. In this study one important aspect is not covered is Network effect of integrated supply chain, logistics , data analysis at stores level which helped the stores to operate on lower cost",
12255,BxDmbGFABJw,Obviously.. stole the farmers at the grassroot level limiting their level of operation. Farmers should be made rich to encourage production.. no incentive should be given to corporations to override the farmers.. now this pattern is followed by many corporations in other countries.,

I have seven close family Members also working for Walmart, and I can tell you that Walmart does reward their employees well if you work hard.    Not only that, our community has been showered with gifts to our educational system, the arts, etc. by the Walton family.   Great company.",

12323,nnwqtZiYMxQ,"I live Mumbai, but, when I came here, about 3 years ago, we started to buy Amul not knowing that the competition was selling far good quality milk at the same price. Previously, I resided in Akola, Maharashtra, where Aarey was selling the same quality milk at 1/2 the rate. So, Amul is just exhausting it&#39;s customers money, and making huge profits by making low quality products.",
12324,nnwqtZiYMxQ,"Amul might be doing good business, but the quality of milk has been continuously worsening. Like here, I live in Mumbai City (District) and the the milk I bought is Amul Taaza (toned). The MRP for the packet of 1/2 litres is 26  but the shopkeepers sell it at 27, some selling for 28 or even 29 rs. And the milk is so thin that it is easily comparable to water. Then, I started buying some alternatives and they offer far superior quality compared to Amul and that too at the same price. So, I request to Amul management team to mind the quality of their products, too.",

12342,nnwqtZiYMxQ,Everything is good...but in lockdown my company which supplies loose and Freshly milked A2 milk increased its volume  hugely as people become more aware about processing industry and moved from packet milk to fresh milk. You may be right on other facts but health benefits on packet milk that&#39;s a question mark. Processing industry can never make a product more healthy. Our traditional way is alwayd better. And I have noticed in bangalore more loose milk seller selling milk after I came in here since last 3 yrs. And all these happened during lockdown. Yes in only smaller area of Bangalore where we supply our dairy products...But this can happen anywhere around the world....,

12399,nnwqtZiYMxQ,the video is irrelevant and read news for some knowledge,
12400,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Excellent video. Two points: 1. Contract farming could still be exploitive as the farmer bears the risk of reduced production and yet selling at lower than market price. During surplus production, &#39;quality&#39; clause is loophole that could be exploited by the buyers to avoid buying all the produce the farmer makes. 2. The lack of legal validity of MSP was supposed to be counterbalanced by a govt buyer, the Food Corporation of India which is assured to be outside Cartals because it is not a private entity. The concept of Govt owned corporation to break monopolies or cartels is used in some countries eg France and is anathema in others eg USA. India belonged to former group with companies like BSNL, FCI, AI etc existing to prevent monopoly and cartelization. The current govt seems  ideologically inclined towards dismantling this model.",

12409,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Pl restrict yourself to English for south indians like me.,
12410,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Why you are giving misinformation....<br>Are you paid?<br><br>MSP stands for a price which is not forced on buyer but it&#39;s a choice given to farmer that if you are not getting this price then come to me, our FCI will buy at this price.<br>APMC created many cartels at each center but without this there would be only two cartel  Adani and Ambani...right?",
12411,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Food for thought, <br>    What if the Government fixes a maximum profit margin(percentage markup from purchase) for the corporates and an MRP, this way neither the farmers nor the consumers are exploited.",

12424,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Wow. First video that helped me understand the importance of the issue.,
12425,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Contract Farming is a norm in the livestock development, at least in Poultry. It happens without any regulation, and they are actually protected to some extent.",
12426,76w6GQ1vs1Y,I am also a Farmer in Maharashtra...and Here is no compulsion to sell produce only in apmc...We usually sell it in our farm...So what govt. Achieve by that provision,
12427,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Absolutely wonderful video and spot on, Ganesh! However, I have one quick addition/counterpoint to this. Making MSPs a norm for 20 odd crops is practically non-viable for the government since rice and wheat are predominantly the largest in the market. MSP acts as a back-up safety net mechanism if the rates fall well below threshold, and MSP was primarily introduced to reduce the exploitative nature of middlemen and also at a time when India faced acute food shortages. Policies in times of surplus food cannot be the same as back-up plans, which is why the govt. cannot bear the grunt of always ensuring MSP in a time where private players have become inevitable like you said. MSP is usually much higher than market rates tbh, and higher MSP also fuels high crop inflation, thereby hurts economic growth. That said, the trade-off in deciding/regulating the MSP by the govt. for each crop is a ridiculously hard but a necessary task to be done.",

12431,76w6GQ1vs1Y,1st time i understood about farm bill. Thank q,
12432,76w6GQ1vs1Y,If we say APMC has loophole then how that is passed in parliament and being followed now?,
12433,76w6GQ1vs1Y,There is loophole in any new system. if identified find a solution to close it and that&#39;s how every system is evolving. If we thing about only possibilities of loopholes then we end doing nothing and stay with old system for ever. This is will lead to another issue in coming years. So something is better than nothing and keep monitoring any loopholes and block it with amendment.,
12434,76w6GQ1vs1Y,you bring up very significant topics with such deep explanation of the concept all together in your video&#39;s. Thanks man for giving your precious time to create awareness in  societies. You are amazing:),
12435,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Very good analysis, it&#39;s hurting that  it has been revoked.. Farmers ko aamir banne nahi denge",

12441,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Farmers do grow crops by taking loan from the buyers which is a common thing and their loan gets deducted when they sell their crops but this laws will end that system so they can&#39;t get loans . Most of the farmers have already took loan from bank so no more loan how will they get money to store crops,
12442,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Bro, you forgot to tellwhat happens if the quality deviates a little from the set standards of starbucks like companies? You forgot to look at the history of companies like starbucks in India on how secured are their farmers? <br>You analysed good on theoretical aspects but missed basic ground realities terribly.",
12443,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Why did the bill restricted the farmers to seek justice in courts in case of their exploitation? Why is there no MSP gurantee if the prospects are so fruitful? Why the jurisdiction was limited upto an IAS officer? Doesnt that answers the very intent behind the law? Can you analyse what was next to happen with farmers?,

12462,76w6GQ1vs1Y,The Farmer&#39;s union wanted to take the bill back completely. Nothing to be applied from the three laws. If there were these issues then why wasn&#39;t it sorted in 15 rounds of talks?? Are you also implying the govt wanted to ruin the farmers??,

12466,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Thank you so much for this video❤️,
12467,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Best explanation!,
12468,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"I must add that reversibility occurs not because we are &#39;addicted&#39;, but because the people AROUND us adjust their expectations.

Now how will you live without mobile data? In fact, this work from home concept started because of mobile data. Without it, nobody would consider home broadband reliable enough for office work!",
12469,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Wonderful unbiased report... Well Done <br><br>1) MSP if implemented with Appropriate Reviews Periodically then this Assurance will protect the Farmers hence he will not Hoard by unnecessarily store in Paid Warehouses again another cost  burden and Buyers cannot form cartel to exploit the farmers and eventually farmers also cannot exploit the buyers - Win-Win situation <br><br>2) Corporates have sophisticated Lawyer Services / Consultants Who Could Come up with not easily Comprehend able Legal Terms and Concepts to the farmers, Govt. Political party lobbies farmers cannot withstand on the other hand poor farmers have nothing in their hand to bargain and/or balance the unfair Advantages &amp; Leverages Corporates may eventually have in the form of Lifestyle/ Business &amp; Agriculture ecosystem changes which he explained with ola taxi concept <br><br>2) Then farmers may be forced to modify/ upgrade the quality of produce by pursuading to invest in technologies/ machinery equipments thereby to get loans with different incomprehensible interest rates and collateral concepts risking farmers society to severe stress and may cause everything to give up farming and their farm lands to corporates to step in acquiring the land held as collateral thereby opening a Pandora box luring other farmers to sell their land at an attractive price initially &amp; forcing the small and surrounded land owners to sell at very unfair exploitative price... This would turn a whole society of farmers into exile leaving their land (once fed them and the entire nation if not the wider world) behind them in the hands of Corporate Exploits and big Richer Business people.<br><br>After the honeymoon with the corporate cash from land sale These people may become unskilled and unemployed and poverty may force these unemployed people to realize they all of them one by one were systematically Cheated by the prevailing system in the society and may turn angry against the society and may lead to violence and civil unrest which certainly put a nation at risk of lawlessness and disrupt to the economy leads to no confidence among society leads to instability and capital fly off inflation and civil unrest to civil war.... With these eventualities Risk in mind policy makers and strategists and bureaucrats should give thorough and multiple dimension factors and analysis before giving to corporate lobbyists and media propaganda and hence would need to talk and assure the fearing farmers and explain to them in lay Man terms and then properly drawn out decision should be taken. People should be very very patient and should check their own emotions under control and hope for the dialogue with relevant stakeholders to get Win-Win situation for all and the nation.",
12470,76w6GQ1vs1Y,And after the fourth step .. corporates will definitely force farmers to use GMO seeds and high use pesticides to grow more.. and we again will start new journey to search for organic NON-GMO foods,

12490,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"If govt brings in MSP below which a Pvt company can&#39;t procure farm produce and on the other end if govt regulates the prices at which the companies can sell those produce to the consumers such that there would be ceiling prices above which the produce can&#39;t be sold, there&#39;d be a very little profit margin for the procuring companies. There would be very less scope for such companies to grow as their revenue/profit will remain more or less stagnant over the years. Even taking inflation and thereby according change in MSP and ceiling prices into consideration, the situation doesn&#39;t change much. In such a scenario, why any pvt company would want to participate, as their sole motivation is growing business and making profits, which is being curbed through such policy. A growing profit-making business not only benefits the company owners but also benefits society through increasing employment/wages and indirectly benefits the shareholders of the company as share prices go up. Considering the merits of the proposed amendments in the farm bills as discussed in the video as well as the probable demerits I mentioned above, govt may set up a few companies like IRCTC, IRFC, BSNL etc, which are not exactly profit-oriented as they monopolise (with the exception of BSNL currently) their respective markets to a certain extent. I said a few companies instead of a single company because it would generate limited competition rather than a monopoly in agro produce market as all the companies would have to comply with the govt regulated MSP and ceiling prices but they would have the freedom to set up their own prices within that range. Hence, the freedom to sell and buy depending upon the price/quality of products would also be transferred to the farmers and consumers respectively.",

12720,RJRYLrkvOyA,The great Adani strategy is having political backing of pmo to push your projects through or get favourable terms in auctions or obtain financing from PSU’s.That is the only strategy which is also known as crony capitalism.Imagine how else an entity with no experience in running even a single airport overnight became the largest airport operator in india.<br>If some thing is too good to be true..in most cases it will not be true,
12721,RJRYLrkvOyA,"That&#39;s why banks need to be private &amp; well governed by RBI RULES &amp; GUIDELINES. Otherwise these groups will keep on becoming RICH &amp; you&#39;ll keep on paying HIGH PRICES for FUEL, EDUCATION, POWER &amp; WATER SUPPLY ETC.",

12724,RJRYLrkvOyA,WTF IS CRORES  CAN YOU JUST USE SOMETHING NORMAL TO NON INDIAN PEOPLE.,
12725,RJRYLrkvOyA,This company is going to drain investor money overnight in a day. And that day is not too far. As a consumer I am not even using one product from their portfolio. Crap company. A company that grew over lies.,
12726,RJRYLrkvOyA,This is not practically possible because buying shares of sister companies is not allowed because of insider trading concept.<br>So technically it is not possible but if you have hands of top government in your hand everything is possible,
12727,RJRYLrkvOyA,It&#39;s a scam...I don&#39;t think you can do what they are doing,
12728,RJRYLrkvOyA,Its somehow same what mehta did but this is little bit more cautiously i think,

12732,RJRYLrkvOyA,"Brother this seems to be a case of fund diversion by the group because when a financial institution especially bank lends money to an entity they clearly mention in the sanction terms that it has to be solely used for that company&#39;s business and not for further lending which is being done by the companies under this group.<br>so in my opinion the bank seems to either not be aware of this stuff or stay quiet despite being aware and thereby putting the depositors money at risk, they rather need to place strict curbs to stop this kind of fund diversion and safeguard their asset",
12733,RJRYLrkvOyA,"But you didn&#39;t cover the part, how adani group is still having high debt? 🤨🤔",
12734,RJRYLrkvOyA,Why this is not considered as insider trading ...?<br>Stealing peoples money 💰,

12781,RJRYLrkvOyA,"Dude the only reason he is growing so much is BJP government, the point you made that Indonesia raised the price of coal is false, what adani did there is called false invoicing of the money, first they setup a false company in a different company and show that they borrowed it from them at so and so amount which is 5 times more than they bought from the Indonesian company, and now they show indian government that they bought the coal at this rate and thats why falsely increasing the price of electricity, also he took 50k acres of land in Gujarat at 1% interest from modi, in recent times bjp and congress helped them get the land in Chattisgarh for mining even if the locals their heavily opposed them, they killed naksals there by falsely accusing them, even the environment protection institute oppose them for ruining the biodiversity where they cut more than 3 lakh trees, he also used the same invoicing strategy for importing equipments for his power plant and took loan accordingly, his fortune after the 2014 is mostly based on corruption and killings, and you know what who is helping him? the chaiwala narendra modi.",

12846,r5OCFaXqS5I,I don’t think it has so much to do with marketing. I’ve not seen a Maggie advertisement in a lifetime at least on a tv what brings me back to Maggie is it’s taste and pricing nothing else which it’s contemporary just can’t match with. Idc if Kylie Jenner sells it.,

12860,r5OCFaXqS5I,"My mom never encouraged me to have Maggi. I did receive free maggi packets at school back in 1990s, for answering quiz questions. But my mom used to give those to kaamwali. But I only started consuming Maggi when I was in hostel and the mess food was an absolute mess. The only reason why I like Maggi is because of it&#39;s taste. Period. I also like Yippie noodles. Their taste is splendid too, especially the double spicey noodles that come in purple color packing. I consume Yippie noodles more than Maggi. <br><br>Let me give you an example. I was once eating maggi. My 2 year old son came to me and was sitting beside me watching TV while I was eating. He smelled the Maggi and asked me to give him a spoonful. When I gave him, he loved it. Later, I also gave him, Top Ramen, Tom Ramen curry, patanjali noodles, knorr noodles, yippie &amp; wai wai. He only loved yippie and Maggi. That&#39;s how my son started consuming noodles. Just for taste. My wife somehow got my son off the instant noodle habit.",
12861,r5OCFaXqS5I,Hey there<br><br>Maybe there are all business tactics according to you (for the reach)<br><br>But I tasted many instant noodles but maggi is the closest to my heart because of its taste <br><br>Maybe there can be marketing for the reach I mean to repeatedly buy it the product needs to satisfy the buyer <br><br>So more than the marketing skills a product needs to be worthy to buy it again ..as a buyer I always think of the taste while purchasing noodles that&#39;s it not the advt or bla bla,
12862,r5OCFaXqS5I,Thank you sir 🙏❤😃,
12863,r5OCFaXqS5I,why it was &quot; only 2 minutes &quot; not 3 minutes or some other number because Maggi actually is not made in 2 minutes.,

13056,k-51exmR9R4,"<b>History repeating like during WW2 and WW1/Spanish plague.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now under WW3 and a corona virus pandemic. Hitler used Zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the fumant removed.  It causes symptoms like corona virus.  Look up in the sky you will see planes spraying your cities!  Hitler attacked Russia, just like what is happening now.  The British Empire had no legal male Heir so they imported a fake one from Germany.  The British Queen&#39;s husband &quot;Prince Philip&quot; renounced his German citizenship, became a Greek citizen and as a Greek citizen moved to Britain gaining citizenship there.  After gaining citizenship, he was appointed a Duke, out of thin air and then as a Prince and married Queen Elizabeth.  &quot;Prince Philip&quot; took the name of the Queen, not the other way, as it usually is done, where a wife takes the husband&#39;s name.  The British Empire has run out of male Heirs at least twice, and they kill to suppress it.    WW2 was a way of hiding this fraud, and now WW3 is a way of hiding that illegal combines Heir. The Bible says that a male would not fail to sit on the throne.  A family name continues through the males, not the females, and Philip was a fraud.  He had become a Greek citizen to make it appear that he was a Royal from the earlier Greek dynasty.</b>  Total theater.  <b>The Catholic Empires of the Roman Empire form one leg and the UK(British controlled) Empire forms the other leg of the Roman Empire, with the King Pope Francis as the ruler of the whole system.  He has a triple teired crown with 666 on it in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  He is a King of the city state of the Vatican(the Vatican is the smallest Country in the world), Rome Italy, and is mentioned in Revelation, Apocalypse, 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions that this Empire is responsible for all those slaughtered on earth.  It mention what the leaders wear, which is scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  The UK leg Royals also wear those colors, a long with Judges and Magistrates of the Crown.  They refer to this entity as the Crown.  When some one goes to court in one of the British subservient Nations, it is said that the Crown has a case against the person.</b>  Canada, Australian and others are not sovereign or free.  please read Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, and study it closely, because this Empire comes as a false system claiming to represent God, but exterminates to stay in power.  <b>1Timothy3:1-16 mentions that the one looking after a group(Church) should be a husband of one wife with obedient children.  The Pope and the Priests of the Catholic Church are forbidden to marry, and so don&#39;t even qualify, according to the very book and God they say they claim to represent(an unmarried man has no wife or children.)   The Bible&#39;s Peter&#39;s mother in-law was cured by Jesus(Yeshua).  So if Peter had a mother in law, then he had a wife as there is no other way.</b>  That is why Catholic Priest have sex with so many little boys, girls and women attendees.  <b>There was over ninety cases of Preists molesting little boys in the city of Boston, USA alone.  None of the Priests were disciplined, but were only moved to a different location, and now you know why.  The whole system is a fraud.</b>  So this organization has many false teachings.  <b>The Roman Emporer forced a combining of Biblical and Pagan beliefs, when Rome Nationalized the Church.  Rome forbid the celebration of Biblical Holy days and Sabbaths under threat of beatings, then confiscation of property and finally death.   Many beheaded or burned alive.</b>  Revelation Apocalypse 18:4 says get out of this organization &quot;my people&quot; if you don&#39;t want to receive her plagues.  <b>Freedom to communicate is under attack by Church and State, up to the point they are threatening to bomb the microprocessor production facilities.</b>  Pray for me and you, please!  <b>Russia says they have the proof that Britain was involved in at least thres major terror attacks against Russia.</b>  Would Russia bomb their own 5+ Billion pipeline, their own bridge, powerplants and Navel yards?  <b>NATO said that they would attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize their island, because Australia would feel threatened, but NATO was militarizing Ukraine, where they had bunkers full of weapons.  NATO&#39;s puppet regime in Ukraine was banning the Russian language and culture even though that was many people&#39;s only language.  The Ukrainian Capital is a Russian word until Western media changed it to hide the Russian history, as Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a recent NATO coup, which the US planned, as they told their dignitaries not to attend the Russian Olympics at that time. You could go to prison for teaching the Russian language. All opposition parties in Ukraine (banned).  Those with out blue arm bands(now yellow?) being put to death.</b>  Many US Officials had been talking about a coming war with Russia and China.  Years in advance.  <b>Donald J Trump said he couldn&#39;t answer corona virus questions claiming we are at war.</b>  Trump said that the US will soon be at war with Russia and China. <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, but are part of China, as acknowledged by most nations of the world till recently.</b>  NATO is planning to do to Taiwan and China what they did to Ukraine and Russia.  <b>Britain fighting for Democracy in Ukraine?  Britain has had two or three Prime Ministers that have not been ellected, trying to help the naked Emporer.</b>  Think!  <b>Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband&#39;s attack is a fraud.  The Police changed and contradicted the events multiple times and it makes no sense.</b>  Corona virus is a code name for information that exposes the crown(Government/Royals).  A vaccine is computer/electronic device program that deletes information from your view(anti virus software).  Symptoms for a biological virus comes from being gased, radiated or sprayed in your environment.  <b>Planes fly in parallel patterns, causing heating of your environment and breathing difficulties.  Like Hitler killed by Zyklon B gas, so now they use a deadly gas in incubators.</b>  Donald J Trump said he would put Hilary R Clinton in prison when ellected for starting a war and genocide in Libya, but when he got in power did nothing.  Americans have started many unjust wars.  <b>America/NATO is about to start wars with Ethiopia, Haiti, Taiwan, Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the list goes on.  NATO Countries have invaded more than half of all sovereign Nations on earth, in the last 30 years.</b>  When you print money on paper and then go buy things with it, and it is not backed by any thing then you have to attack a lot of people to keep the scheme going.  <b>New Central Bank digital currencies(CBDCs) will be centralized and backed only by cow farts and trust, where as Bitcoin is decentralized and backed by gold.  Bitcoin/gold and silver came under a major attack by the crown(governments).  The digital currencies will create a M.O.B. type system, that if you get in government cross hairs you will be shut out of the system just like Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Russia and so on and so on.  If they do it to a complete Country, then they will have no problem doing it to individuals.  Canada confiscated people&#39;s money breaking international law.</b>  Rome enters a Country, exterminates, and keeps the remaining people&#39;s in refugee camps called Reserves.  Periodically they thin out the population.  They usually make a lot of noise about sport team names with Native names and how people are trying to erase their names, so as to hide the real erasure of actual peoples.  <b>Revelation 7:9, God says he would take out of all Nations and Tribes and Peoples a people for himself.  God accepts all those who accept him of all Nationalities.</b>  Donald J Trump started operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American people by military nurses.  Trump added death by electrocution, firing squad, poison gas to the already used lethal injection.   <b>Trump foretold war on Russia and China years in advance, a said no one would protect the Pope more than him.</b>  America turned it&#39;s back on God, so now he is turning his back on you.  <b>The US, Canada, Germany, Italy, Britain, Australia, Austria, Ukraine and many other Nations refused to agree and voted against a move at the United Nations to condemn Nazism.  Russia voted against Nazism.  Remember the Nazis?  They started WW2 and exterminated 12000000 human beings, often by extremely cruel means.  The Ukraine military has a entire Nazi battalion the Azov Nazi battalion.  Church leaders clearly seen in Hitler&#39;s Nazi SS footage blessing the troops before slaughters.  The Azov Steel Works was full of Nazis that surrendered to Russia, with pictures confirming their Nazi swastikas tattooed on their bodies.</b>  Ukraine banned all opposition parties and is trying to exterminate the Russian language, people and culture.  Teachers are sent to prison for teaching the Russian language in areas where most only speak Russian.  <b>Fighting for Democracy?</b>  Britain installed two Prime Ministers that were not elected.  <b>Donald J Trump used his office while President to start a business so called &quot;Truth Social&quot; that he claimed would enable free speech.  Later Mr.Trump tried to get the Justice department to stop late night hosts from talking about him.  So supposedly creating free speech over here, but attacking free speech over there.</b>  Russia and China no longer accept US fiat currency, so G7 banned Russian gold. Supposed unbiased media not allowing comments, is a mass deception and contrary to their purpose. CBDCs attacking crypto. 1933 the US confiscated gold.   For 50 years, 10 years in prison for having it, and only ended when gold was separated from backing money in 1971 now backed by cow farts. 2022 Biden bans Russian gold.  Military wearing US/UK flags in Ukraine. UK/Rome&#39;s &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;² UK suppression",

13362,IBbz8sjVz6I,"This is the fourth video of his that I&#39;ve watched, and while I was initially impressed with his analysis, I&#39;m already detecting a disturbing trend of anti-EU/anti-USA bias. Unusual take since his home country, India, is aligning itself solidly with the Western powers more and more with each passing year. India itself is far more concerned with China&#39;s future hegemony than it is with Western  hegemony. But when listening to this biased propaganda, one would think it&#39;s not so. Also, I find it laughable that some comments seem to think he&#39;s so &quot;unbiased&quot; because he&#39;s from India! 🤣 So he&#39;s automatically the smartest, and least biased one in the room because of his race!? Listen to yourselves! Anyways, as an average Joe American speaking to any good-hearted, average Joe&#39;s or Jane&#39;s anywhere else in the world. Guess what!?

13368,IBbz8sjVz6I,Is it same after 4 months ???? Has it been better for Russia ??? Is Europe been able to cope up ?,
13369,IBbz8sjVz6I,"It is more complicated. Russia is being hurt also, but Putin has an advantage in having an authoritarian government. The real conflict will not be so much within the EU, but between the EU and the US. US gas companies are now selling gas to the EU at 3 - 10 times the price that EU was paying Russia. But for the US the problem is domestic politics. We have been at war now for over 20 years. And the people at the bottom have been taking a beating. The US has inequality that is comparable to a third-world country. The US economy is being hurt very little compared to the EU and third world because of sanctions. But that little could be enough to generate political chaos. Americans do not really care about foreign policy when the domestic economy is poor. So we could have the EU turning against the US, while the American people turn against the Biden administration. People around the world are seeing how dangerous the US is. They are taking steps to protect themselves from unilateral US sanctions. The US must give up some power. But so far there is no indication that it will do so peacefully. If the US goes into recession, the rest of the world should be frightened. Remember how Hitler pulled Germany out of the depression. The US is a wartime economy. We know only one way to solve problems. Bomb, invade, sanction.",

Which is exactly why Russia  got drones from Iran and munitions from NK. Western media has repeatedly said the sanctions was long term and they&#39;re.. Putin needs a deal now and he knows it. Russians will quit supporting this war once it starts hitting Russian citizens. Matter of time. Simple that they can&#39;t sustain their cruise missile usage and etc with the sanctions In place.

13403,31UVvKEYO6k,It&#39;s not always about aspirational value or celebrity who endorse it. It&#39;s about not purchasing Chinese brand as well. Many Indians prefer Indian products these days. I used to have JBL head phones before but later I chose Boat and even in watches noise for the same reason and I will keep doing it. Similarly when it comes to phone Chinese phones don&#39;t attract me I will go for Samsung,

13420,31UVvKEYO6k,Yesss... It absolutely made difference... It vastly shifted the demographic of the ad viewers by changing the icons starring in it..... While SRK and Hardik Pandiya are famous among all ages... BB and Carry are recognised by the youth.... They are rising stars who resonate with the young masses more... So the product would lose a wide market share... Tht it could have offered it&#39;s products to... But in return gains the attention of the young population... By starring Carry or BB,

Oneplus One craze in tech community was so high in 2014 that people use to sell reference link for $100 in Craigslist. Proud owner of Oneplus One… I still have that phone with me.,
13423,31UVvKEYO6k,So basically both one plus and boat used celebrities to push their product along with a low price point,

13425,31UVvKEYO6k,"Boat on quality front is ok,but the perceived value of the brand is higher due to endorsement by a Cricketer &amp; Bollywood artiste.Lastly some spill over benefit of Shark Tank episode to the brand.",
13426,31UVvKEYO6k,It’s naive to say that humans can’t discern the quality of the earphone . They absolutely can. You can 💯 % tell the difference between a cheap headset and a Bose or a Sony. The noise cancellation isn’t the same on the cheaper ones.,

13433,31UVvKEYO6k,Congratulations to them for reaching this position! It’s truly crazy!! But….<br>I have faced quite a lot quality issues after a short period of buying their products….hence I’ve decided to buy from any other company but boAt.<br>And I have about 5-6 friends with the same opinion.<br><br>They should really work on the longitivtiy of their products.,

13437,31UVvKEYO6k,"I think that the real reason for boat&#39;s success was aggressive pricing and good customer support during warranty period, rather than celebrity endorsements, that is secondary.",
13438,31UVvKEYO6k,People bought one plus 7 because what an amazing specs they provided in 5 and 6 at mid market range .. and after 8 series the downfall of one plus started<br>Edit: I still use one plus 6 along with iPhone pro max,

13445,31UVvKEYO6k,First you&#39;ve missed Sony in this picture. Second boat audio is not that good to amaze a audiophile or a good heavy user.<br>.<br> I&#39;m heavy user of overhead phones.Due to work I use Bose qc35ii for almost 10hrs a day. My cousin hyped me for his boat wireless and i tried. I couldn&#39;t bear it  even for 10 mins. Going premium for them is very difficult beacause they&#39;ll need research and development facility.  Also compete with sony Bose and apple. <br>.<br>Third they are going in smart watch market which is totally different to making earphones. So i doubt the brand.,
13446,31UVvKEYO6k,"Very well explained, keep it going my friend!",

13455,31UVvKEYO6k,"The fact is that, Boat wanted to make it a world class brand not only in India that&#39;s why they choose Hardik Pandya because all over the world there are more peoples who watch cricket rather than carry or bb King vines videos. <br><br>Thank you ❤",

13469,31UVvKEYO6k,"Yes, the choice of ambassadors did make a difference. Mivi&#39;s earphones have metallic polish. It&#39;s shiny. Things that are shiny, things that are fluorescent are preferred by reactive people, who don&#39;t have any authoritative figures. They are all about entertainment. And that&#39;s why mivi chose CarryMinati. Carry is a reactive, hyperactive person on screen who makes people laugh at his reactivity or hyperactive behavior. On the other hand, boat has positioned itself as something sturdy and strong, and you can see that its exterior looks rugged. Any person who would like something strong is a person who follows strong authoritative figures and is passionate at heart. That&#39;s why they chose Hardik Pandya. It&#39;s all about the positioning and presentation of the USP of the product.",

13479,31UVvKEYO6k,Hi bro make a video of realme phone company,
13480,31UVvKEYO6k,For me the main reason for buying a boat earphones is its hastle free and no questions asked replacement. That too at the cost of a wireless chinese earphone which costed me 300-350; with Boat i could buy wireless for 600 which is not much of a difference,
13481,31UVvKEYO6k,BoAt products are Made in China,

13490,31UVvKEYO6k,The consumer base of both groups carryminati and the rishab pant makes the difference. That&#39;s from my side,
13491,31UVvKEYO6k,"I think it&#39;s an oversimplification to attribute one plus&#39; success to the campaign featuring Robert downey jr. As far as I&#39;ve observed over the years, one plus became popular because they delivered stupendous value for money and a clean UI with customisations available. Their phones used to sell like hot cakes even before the aforesaid ad campaign, the ad campaign may have helped in boosting sales but it wasn&#39;t as significant as you&#39;ve made it out to be.",
13492,31UVvKEYO6k,One video on sula vineyards,

13495,31UVvKEYO6k,I think that the main reason for their success is that they bought up a brand value using celebraties + budget friendly product in market...when compared to other products they were missing any one of these.Hence they had a good market uplift,

They have not kept up with modern agri techniques ... because there are clans of farmers who are making crores from farming and then there are the other small farmers who gasp for air . In India if there is a skewed distribution of wealth , skills and power in any sector that has to be agri sector. Not to mention the brokers who bleed small farmers to death .... just a few months back the rich farmer clans so eloquently kept the whole system alive .",

13596,DzZCVqrtXYw,Literally this video made me cry how farmers were been looted for not giving enough share of profit to even survive<br><br>Thanku ITC,
13597,DzZCVqrtXYw,so were they buying directly from farmers?<br>and if through apmc then what difference did it make?,

13601,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,"I think the benefits for the common person is highly outweighed by the losses. I mean paying for messaging apps, losing our privacy to government officials and this bill stifling innovation are way greater threats to our personal freedoms than receiving a few spam calls a day. The biggest point is, this gives the government way too much control than they should have in a democratic country. They are elected and supposed to work for the people...this bill total subverts that. If national security is their only argument to stand on (when there already exists other IT acts that take care of this problem), then the formation of this bill is truly suspicious (not all of it but major parts of it at least).",
13602,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,Let&#39;s be China as much as we can. There should be one bjp and that&#39;s it. No other opposition should stand against bjp. That&#39;s how bjp govt working right now.,

13608,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,India is going to be just like China in terms of digital privacy (0),
13609,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,"Good coverage. It would also help if you talk about how banks and Telecom companies in India are colluding to create false identities, creating demat accounts with these identities , taking control of your online (and consequently your offline life) presence, siphoning off govt funds right under the nose of GoI with these identities...in reality you are only the face of virtual identity they&#39;ve created. It&#39;s the mafia that is controlling Indians and all of this is made possible through apps that ask for access to your mic, wifi, bluetooth, images, and every damn folder on your phone. Every new app out there is &quot;innovating &quot; for the mafia and not for the people. And they keep the momentum of the so-called libertarian narratives that the GoI is killing innovation blah blah blah.  Truth is GoI is finally taking steps to rein in and control apps that are aiding the mafia building a parallel economy and completely derailing real economy for Indians. This is reality and if you take a closer look at outsourcing in banks, app updates on Google Play... you&#39;ll understand that you are working day in and day out for filling the mafia coffers and GoI is trying to protect you from these economy looters. &quot;Freedom and innovation&quot; are buzzwords that aid a thriving mafia that makes you work for it and uses you as a tool against the elected government. You are either the mafia&#39;s tool or it&#39;s enemy. Make your choice. Read the draft bill and share your day-to-day experiences as a citizen of this country, at every public service touch point pertaining to telecom service providers viz., banks, hospitals, postal services, retail, e-commerce and app delivery platforms. We or the GoI are not in control of these channels anymore because of laws that aren&#39;t updated to manage this new world. Read, think and share your viewpoints. Put your critical thinking hat on and stop slaving over esoteric ideas about &quot;innovation&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; They are just constructs of a mind that is trained to &quot;fight&quot;law makers. It&#39;s merely a distraction. Get to reality - Fight the mafia and take control of your economy and your life. Make the law your partner and make it as stringent as possible for the mafia - that&#39;s exactly what the GoI is trying to do. If you are not a mafia tool,  there is nothing to be afraid of. Build and protect this nation for your future generations. Jai Hind.",
13610,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,Is video commenrts me log bol rahe hai ki positive criticism hai. Is video me agar Government ki jagah Modi Government bol deta to in sabki g***d jal jati.,
13611,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,The bill doesn&#39;t seem to be all bad as is being projected in a few media platforms. Licensing apps is unnecessary and undesirable but unbridled roll out of apps can also be a problem - instead of licensing apps there should be a mechanism to ban harmful apps and there should be checks and balances to ensure that this power to ban is not absolute. Similarly with internet shutdown - the power should not be absolute.,
13612,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,&quot;National Security&quot; actually means the Security of BJP government. This man is destroying our country.,
13613,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,"Rubbish comments, childish",
13614,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,This guy has half understanding of the draft bill.,
13615,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,this seems to similar to freakin Net Neutrality,
13616,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,"Please remove the background music, its unnecessary and just &#39;noise&#39;.thanks.",
13617,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,This is Chinese sponsored…,
13618,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,&quot;A matter of National Security&quot;. The age-old cry of the oppressor.,
13619,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,"This is the first video where I majorly disagree on most of your points:<br>1. Carrier v/s. Content: This is a long-standing issue in US too... Netflix / YouTube vs Comcast. It is not about &quot;leveling field&quot; as you say. It is because network providers like comcast are not ready to get bogged down just because YouTube / Netflix offered 4K services. Obviously Carrier is spending more to shuttle all that extra traffic and paying for hardware / bandwidth and they will have to raise their network prices. What is the advantage for the carrier? It has only been resolved by higher internet prices for home and excessively so for mobile. Just study US market with the highest carrier prices (home / mobile).<br>2. Data-Privacy / Lawful Interception: I agree. Btw, the way there is no need for a platform to enable 2-way encryption. If you really need to encrypt your communication (for whatever purposes, corporate, personal, govt. etc.) there are always means to do that (sender and receiver can both agree on 100&#39;s of mechanisms out there). Platform doesn&#39;t necessarily need to provide that service. It is a bonus for people who do not know. My apologies for the crude example... It is same as knowing how like a Mafia know how to dispose off a dead body vs just dumping it in a secluded place in a suitcase not knowing if any witnesses saw it or CCTVs caught it.<br>3. User / Caller Identity: You are misconstruing facts here. There is a difference between &quot;Privacy&quot; and &quot;Anonymity&quot;. Same debate can be had for &quot;Ensuring a Single Person in an ATM booth with hidden keypad&quot; v/s &quot;Wearing a Helmet in an ATM booth&quot;. <br>4. KYC:  Know-Your-Customer/Consumer is necessary... Not-having-KYC is absolutely not in conflict or serve any benefit for the consumer in any form or manner.<br>5. Insolvency Code: Why Govt. shouldn&#39;t get back control of the Spectrum in case of insolvency. Banks own the financial / funding of operations aspect; they don&#39;t own the spectrum / technology. It is like if you are bankrupt, the bank which loaned your house will now own your wife / spouse. There is no transitive ownage concept like in the feudal system of yore. What can be given, can be revoked. It is that simple. Consumer-will changes and Govt-security is the only debatable point here. A very loose one at that as in that too consumer in a free market is free to choose.<br>6. Internet Lockdown: Why this is even a problem. Internet is not a &quot;Fundamental Right&quot;. Every country has an &quot;Emergency / Crisis / National Security&quot; provision. In case of &quot;Financial Distress&quot; SEBI / Market has the right to choose, why shouldn&#39;t Govt. In case of a war or such conditions &quot;Civil rights are dissolved&quot;. Lawful blockage of internet or a wire-tap (a non-fundamental right) is also had via Legal means. It is not in Govt. / Police hands. What is even the point here?<br><br>Of course, there are problems of over-reach / opposition suppression, those are the &quot;real&quot; points to be addressed here...",

Has that killed innovation?<br>Just go through GDPR, and you will find India&#39;s telecom law is still as sweet as honey.<br>Misusing internet shut down to orchestrate riot is as stupid a comment as it can be imagined.

Although China is not much further ahead I&#39;d wager. General lack of experience in Naval operations from the officer class down. I would also suspect there is some issue with corruption in the Indian military, as many Indians have complained to me about rampant corruption in Indian politics and business.

BRI infrastructure is growing exponentially like Power of Siberia 2, and ever more trains in the northern belt as well as the cental belt.

13803,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Puma 💙,
13804,yxC9kgS8lnQ,no point in comparing REEBOK.....after its buyout by ADIDAS it would play 2nd fiddle...and the indian arm was down with scandal of misappropriation...but yes KUDOS to PUMA,
13805,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Puma products sold in india are low quality<br>They are made in india to keep the price lower and hence heavy compromise of quality .,

13818,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Puma is comparatively budget friendly,
13819,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Because puma is cheap,
13820,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Because of king 👑👑🔥🐉 kohli,
13821,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Fun fact founder of adidas and puma were brothers,
13822,yxC9kgS8lnQ,For over 20 years I preferred Puma in general over other sports brands.,
13823,yxC9kgS8lnQ,NIKE ...Always,
13824,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Nike go BIG or go HOME. wait when shoe industry in india crosses billion at sports level. if india hosts olympics then nike can come big!<br>adidas and puma are fantastic too. german offer top quality always.<br>----------------------<br>EDGE STILL GOES TO NIKE.

THEN THEY STARTED GIVING TOUCH IN FASHION ON SHOE LEVEL AND OTHER PRODUCTS  UNIKE GERMAN PRODUCTS WHO ALWAYS HAVE EYE ON ELEGANCY NOT AS FUSSY AS ITALIANS  AND FRENCH THOUGH!<br>-----------<br>SO WHILE ADIDAS AND PUMA MAY LOOK HIGHLY FASHIONABLE THEY ARE NOT AS RUGGED AS NIKE.<br>WHO ALSO HAVE CUTTING EDGE FASHIONABLE SHOES THESE DAYS( JORDAN BRAND IS THE MOST SOLD IN THE WORLD).<br><br>IF SALVATORE FERRIGAMO GOES TO WORK THOSE SHOES WOULD COST 3 TO 4 TIMES WHAT NIKE AND ADIDAS CHARGE.<br><br>DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!,

13831,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Addidas is not true to size and is not worth.. The costs of products are 5x to the actual value,
13832,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"You can get a good looking good quality sneaker from PUMA for 2700, a shoe like that from nike would cost you 10k, And that makes the difference (besides virat kohlis&#39;s immense presence)",

13843,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Nike destroyed? What a joke 🤣,

13847,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"I have used Puma, adidas and Nike, Puma is price effective i think that&#39;s the reason it is doing good in the market, otherwise if you buy a shoes  from these brands say like at 2K then quality of Nike shoes are way too good. My point is that probably Nike is targeting to make a best product and not just profit.",
13848,yxC9kgS8lnQ,One point could have been added concerning the online shopping experience. Puma&#39;s website and app experience is miles ahead of what I experienced with the apps of Nike &amp; Addidas.,
13849,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Nike to nike hain🔥,
13850,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Well known brand + cheap price compared to competition is what taken Puma to summit,

13859,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Price most important factor,

13907,VPFGqmFTKSM,Excellent... 👍,
13908,VPFGqmFTKSM,"Here is a basic problem I see with  Indian startups in general,  almost all the startups (the so-called unicorns) are rarely (if ever) based on some new technology. Sure companies like nykaa and byju&#39;s may have a good business model. But the problem with a good business model is that you cannot make it proprietary. Anyone can copy it. <br>I think the focus should be more on novel technology/ processes that a startup has to offer and not just on valuation and business models.",
13909,VPFGqmFTKSM,Chapter 11 is coming for all of them.,

13912,VPFGqmFTKSM,"Hi, bro this ed tech is a stupid idea, <br>Since there is no interaction between the students and teachers how can one show her/her emotions to the education, or one can learn without school and colleges , if education is getting online then why need to schools and colleges in this world? Education is not a business...,  it&#39;s a knowledge with love and emotions with the interaction between two people, <br>No one can express ther love and others ones emotion through online <br>It fake friends with online rather better than a school of sharing information and lunch with your friends,...

13915,VPFGqmFTKSM,Then how udemy is so successful?? It&#39;s because they are able to give it on low cost. Choice of options are diverse. Their classes are high quality..problem with indian education setups is they love to exploit as much as they can when trend is on boom. This mentality creates byjus kind of concepts.,

13933,VPFGqmFTKSM,"&quot;Byju&#39;s &quot; is not what it portrays to be , as a parent I know what my daughter and her classmates had to undergo.

13942,VPFGqmFTKSM,I think school before 1 hr of exam <br>1min=&gt; 4hrs<br>Nowadays cause of procrastination is school!!,
13943,VPFGqmFTKSM,"No one can destroy iron but it&#39;s own rust will, just like this these edtech companies are fighting among each other and soon one will swallow another. The problem with PW is that they are not matching the demand to supply. They are providing too much when there&#39;s no demand for them. I think in the long run only unacademy will survive as they know the business the best. They don&#39;t have followers, they have students. You give them money and they teach you, simple. But in case of apni kaksha and PW there&#39;s a lot more and people are expecting too much from them. And since they&#39;re so cheap too many non serious students are buying them which will prevent serious students from buying them. They won&#39;t be able to produce results in the long run. And PW as a company is getting into too much controversies. Last few months there have been more controversies than teaching in PW which is not at all good for companies reputation. I decided to buy competishun insted of PW just because I didn&#39;t wanted to take part in any of their lafdas. Unacademy is the only edteach which is stable right now but again we never know what&#39;s gonna happen.",

14008,1qEZwj_Iacw,When will this be functional in India (~75% population),
14009,1qEZwj_Iacw,"It is pretty good conceptually. But if you think about it- this is going to be used to develop new business of either private insurance policy or gov. insurance. Having single database poses risk of data and digital privacy. This is going to be same problem like we have in US making medical system so expensive and monopolized. Use this concept but make this limited between service provider and patient and then give ability to patient to share this to anyone. Plus, data classification is needed which helps tag certain data type as gov sharable data then no shareable data, sharable data only on demand and those demands should have proper requirement digital legal codes with laws added to it. Think more and then implement it. Idea is good but learn from western countries who face major issues with non parametrized digitalization.",

If govt makes this software secure and much cheaper than current one we will adopt it otherwise i would use custom software in accordance with national one specific to my own hospital! Most of the free ones or current govt softwares are limited and its greatly limited in features and accessibility.  Even if its secure how would govt plan to implement it on tier 1-3 healtcare facilities and how would we as doctors be able to navigate it ...the help support is nil and underdeveloped ..even 102 is understaffed in my state! Hope modiji makes healthcare better than it is currently... and its running at its peak as of today! Also i would like to get a section for staff requirements and other things so that the platform can be fully utilized instead of giving out ads in newspaper or word of mouth. It should also have a rating system which cant be manipulated so that better hospitals are appreciated and seen. Doctors with their license and reg no should be shown with years of practice and personal doctor ratings!,

14085,1qEZwj_Iacw,"There are two aspects to healthcare: availability of good doctors and hospitals is one, accessibility and affordability is the other. India needs to work on both. And by providing the financial backing to those who need it most, India has taken a very important step in the right direction. This issue is much better taken care of in countries like Germany. However, despite top quality doctors and hospitals most Americans find it difficult to get health care, leave alone good health care because millions have no insurance and all those who live outside of major metropolitan cities have poor quality doctors and hospitals. Waiting time is often months and emergency services are staffed poorly. American spending on healthcare is almost twice as high as Germany’s but the health outcome is worse than in Germany!",

14188,qL4DvHZUPfc,Sir big fan.. i request you to make a. Video on the house of tata.. how did it become india’s most valued corporation,
14189,qL4DvHZUPfc,"I use Paytm payment banks . It has two benefits,provide interest, and no transactions headache in our bank statement. And Paytm wallet is best.",
14190,qL4DvHZUPfc,I think you missed Dividend distribution tax component in computation. That should be included in dividend payout calculations for comparison. Correct me if I am wrong,
14191,qL4DvHZUPfc,"Ganesh I salute you bro, your teaching skills is top notch and your clarity of thoughts is outstanding. It&#39;s always a pleasure to watch your videos ❤️ keep up the great work.",
14192,qL4DvHZUPfc,can&#39;t it be considered as short selling our own company shares ?,
14193,qL4DvHZUPfc,Phone pe is good than anyone in every manner,
14194,qL4DvHZUPfc,The video was good but you forgot the fact that it was an open market offer and not a tender offer.<br>Which means Paytm can buyback its shares from market at any price upto a max of Rs 810 and until now it hasn&#39;t even reached above rs 600 yet,
14195,qL4DvHZUPfc,Dude for example 18% of the inclusive gst for 10000 is 1525.42 but for exclusive tax it is 1800 . There’s huge difference in those values. The calculations are wrong in the video either way,

14199,qL4DvHZUPfc,@think school - This approach of unnecessarily giving 100s of examples to explain the case study is really very boring and monotonous. You often deviate from the Topic by sharing these Silly EXAMPLES and spend 90% of the time on examples rather than explaining the case. This not only makes your Video lengthy but Boring as well. An ideal case  study has 3 Aspects - 1.) Background of the problem 2.) Problem Statement  3.) Solution  4.) the Impact of the Case on the viewers/audience. Your case studies miss most of the key ingredients and Focus on those Silly examples of - &quot;if Ram buys 100 shares of Rs. 10 each it will bring Rs. 1000&quot;...These examples are really stupid as every layman understands these things. You waste your&#39;s and our time by quoting More examples than Required.,

14208,nPrVYCtJfgQ,Bhai.. bohot dil laga ke sikhata hai tu 🙏,
14209,nPrVYCtJfgQ,You are too diplomatic to speak truth. Looks like you chose money over morality. At least have guts to quote twitter’s founder that Twitter employees are leftist. Censorship was mostly targeted towards right wing.,
14210,nPrVYCtJfgQ,Hate speech is great. It might teach people how to not listen to idiots while they remain vocal instead of silencing them. You can not filter bad from good if you never encounter bad.,
14211,nPrVYCtJfgQ,So the solution is: Elon should buy our education system to turn millions of dumb monkeys into humans capable of operating their free speech.,
14212,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"bro.. your research needs to include listening to the &#39;other side&#39;, including those people that MSM says are &#39;far right&#39;, &#39;extremists&#39;, &#39;hateful bigots&#39;, etc. because then you realise those are actually smears on mostly moderate-thinking/centrist people trying to speak out on shenanigans. it&#39;s all part of US domestic politics/power struggles, and you&#39;re getting swept/up fooled by one side&#39;s propaganda.",

14218,nPrVYCtJfgQ,I always allighned with your videos. But I have a point of difference with this one. You have mentioned about a fine line which cannot be defined. If the argument of loaded guns in the hands of sightly evolved monkey is right then how could we justify equal voting rights to every citizen. Shouldn&#39;t we filter that also based on lot of parameters? But we can&#39;t right.,
14219,nPrVYCtJfgQ,I disagree with the fact that only some people should free speech because if only selected people have it that would turn out be dictatorship but with extra steps.,
14220,nPrVYCtJfgQ,How can people dislike such a great piece of content.,
14221,nPrVYCtJfgQ,Dude I have the exact same T shirt from Wrogn!!<br><br>I feel Elon Musk is too overrated by the US. In our country we consider billionaires are forerunners in developing the nation. This guy is too arrogant and dont care about the people’s priorities.<br>I mean who told you we want to go to Mars. We love our planet. Stop planning stupid missions just to fulfill your ego. The same is the case with Twitter’s takeover. Who asked you to worry about free speech.<br>I think we as investors must question his decisions. He is a billionaire because of invested wealth and not accumulated wealth nor assets,
14222,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"I say buying Twitter  by Elon musk  has it&#39;s own Republican politics,  after his buying Twitter  he reopened Donalad trump&#39;s account...soon Twitter will be closed or temporarily closed before USA election  ,this will happen  I bet",
14223,nPrVYCtJfgQ,Don&#39;t use click baits in thumbnails  please,
14224,nPrVYCtJfgQ,I disagree with your freedom of speech take. FOS should be available to all. As it allows good and bad ideas to surface. <br><br>Saying only a select few should have FOS is the same as saying only a select few intellectuals should be allowed to vote,
14225,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"This video is very disappointing, to call all people who air their opinion as trolls sounds so much like the old mainstream media . You can do better than this. Once a Youtuber gets famous he becomes elitist",
14226,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"The monkey analogy is incorrect for 2 reasons: <br>1.  Unlike those the monkey shoots at, the people in twitter can choose to filter out and see tweets only from people they want to follow. <br>2. You assume you or some committee of moderators can tell what misinfo is. It has only resulted in political capture and sinecures for otherwise unemployables.",

14230,nPrVYCtJfgQ,If Elon kush should have taken you as an advisor in his company Twitter acquisition wouldn&#39;t have taken place for sure... Amazingly explained ...,
14231,nPrVYCtJfgQ,good to know you are not  a bhakt,
14232,nPrVYCtJfgQ,You got wrong definition of free speech bro,
14233,nPrVYCtJfgQ,It is undoubtedly an attempt to close Twitter,
14234,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"Thinkschool is usually pretty good but they are absolutely completely wrong on this one.<br>1. yes, the description of echo chambers and how they can cause riots is accurate. But the fact that algorithms are designed to promote this for business interest is absolutely wrong., The algortihms are designed this way to profit USA causing instability in countries they like to topple to loot resources. Like by doing Arab spring or right now causing unrest in iran etc. before social media, they used to use NGO&#39;s for this purpose, Read the case of Libya for that. <br><br>2. The definition of free speech is wrong. free speech is inhibition of speech by government. it does not apply to private corporations making their own community guidelines to curtail speech. Elon is talking about US and EU government interference in social media platforms being removed and not making the platform free for all. Which is why USA and EU have totally lost their minds and are threatening to ban twitter altogether.<br><br>3. Read manufacturing consent by Naom Chomsky to understand what this entire thing is., Briefly - defence contractors and wall street pays donations to politicians in USA. Politicians start wars to make money for defence contractors. The resulting economic disruption means that fed can raise rates and dollar becomes stronger and in the swinging market, wall street makes money. At the same time energy companies and other giant companies get benefit as USa and Eu loot resources from these war torn countries. the same fed rate hikes that strenghten dollar, weaken other currencies and cause recession all over the world. But because west has a stronger labour market it didnt affect them till now. Since 2008, developing countries have turned the tables but that is a separate story.<br><br>Now the politicians create these wars through social media. But how? Look, the same corporations that profit from wars and give donations to politicians also control western media - through advertising. western media then structures itself to only hire people that spread propaganda that supports and justifies USA wars and bashes any country that disagrees even a little bit. You dont have to curtail speech when you can control the thoughts of people. because what they need is support from their own people to spread the narrative that their brutal wars are &quot;justified&quot;.<br><br>But social media is different. On this every person can speak. So here the western governments have their own bots to spread narratives and departments that remove any content that disagrees with them, Just recently there was a report that Department of Homeland security in USA was purging posts that countered western narrative of Ukraine war. And they use advertisers to pressure social media to maintain algorithms that favor this narrative as well.<br><br>Some platforms are able to maintain echo bubbles of two different groups on the same plaform who rarely converse with each other. Google has been able to maintain that., But in USA most platforms have gone further than that. Just like media in west has divided itself into left and rigth, dem and repub, so has social media. Which means that advertisers.corporations supporting dems buy ads on certain social media platforms which makes that platform dem leaning and vice versa with repubs. Facebook has become more and more repub leaning and twitter had become more and more left leaning.<br><br>But now  the platforms are no longer restricted to USA. They have spread out into the world. and the narrative in these countries will be totally different from USA. Now USA has been trying to use these platforms to spread their own narrative and suppressing everyone else. This has caused these platforms to not be very popular elsewhere and reports of these riots caused through these platforms have given them a serious reputational blow. At the same time, these other countries have started their own platforms which support their narrative and are gaining popularity world wide and coming back and causing dents in western narrative when their own citizens use it. That is why all this banning nonsense starts.<br><br>So this causes a fundamental problem. Now businesses only care about making more and more money. So they have noticed two things.<br>1. because of political influences domestically, they have to ban all the users who dont politically agree with the echo chamber they support. Like twitter banned most trump supporters.<br>2. Because of inernational geopolitics they get banned from other countries.<br>In both cases they are losing users and at the same time are facing more competition as new platforms pop up. Eg trump starting truth social. In the meantime, the social divide keeps growing. But so does the gvt control on the platform. So even the users on it cant speak their minds due to  fear of censorship and they lose interest and engagement declines and they move to new platforms who are at the beginning of this cycle. That is what is happening with facebook. And as the engagement declines, advertisers pull out and revenue drops and these companies fail. We are seeing the start of that for many social media companies.<br><br>So to stay ahead of this game, they are looking for ways to change all of this. And it basically comes down to something that sounds like an oxymoron but isnt. To get more advertising revenue through higher engagement, these companies have to come out from under the control of advertisers. They need to flip the balance. Instead of advertisers/corporations-politician nexus aka deep state controlling the platform, the platform needs to control advetisers. But that means massive disruption, advertisers pulling our, social media company finding a way to remain profitable regardless, expanding to new countries and more people joining and advertisers coming back on the social media company&#39;s terms. <br><br>And this is good for countries like India because then our side of the story gets told and counters western propaganda.  But for that, these bubbles need to burst, people from different political ideologies and countries need to be put on the platform and algorithm needs to be designed to promote interaction between them. Echo chambers drive one kind of engagement. But bursting of these echo bubbles cause another kind of engagement which is good for growth of the platform and good for society as well. And That is what Elon is trying to do - remove the deep state censorship from social media. he is not sitting there trying to resolve the free speech debate. <br><br>As for that debate, I completely disagree with you there. You suggest that botched censorship of social media should beexcused because algorithm cannot decide morality of free speech. My argument is that that is why it shouldnt decide anything. We already have laws regarding what kind of speech is allowed. When you are walking on the street, you are pretty much allowed to say a lot of things except threaten someone, slander someone, or say incendiary things etc. So if social media companies want to operate in a country, they have to follow that countries regulations of free speech. As for international content, maximum possible allowance of free speech needs to be achieved between countries. It may not be perfect but making this sytem 1000 times better than what it is right now is really not that hard.<br><br>PS since he sold a bunch of his shares to raise the capital for the purchase, I have a sneaking suspicion that he purposefully id driving the stocks down so he can buy them back at a lower price before he actually makes the platform successful and their value rises again.",
14235,nPrVYCtJfgQ,You perfectly mentioned that censorship is necessary and i kinda agree to it. Can you really say that Twitter was applying censorship equally for different political and religious groups??,
14236,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"Well Itotally agree with the argument of echo chambers. But why the platform operators are trying suppress on particular ideology??!!<br>Also, the report says Twitter is the platform of &quot;hate speech&quot; and it has shot up 4 times; please ask the publisher to define hate speech!",
14237,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"Elon knows, Facebook and insta is shitcoz I love Twitter with youtu5",
14238,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"Humans are not monkeys. You support support censorship, who should then censor? By the way who sponsored your video?",
14239,nPrVYCtJfgQ,Well man listen you&#39;re just scratching the tip of the iceberg. Please listen to the Joe Rogan episode with the former twitter management. They have accepted to be suppressing any right wing or conservative views. Involvement of cambridge analytica to target ads during 2019 elections hired by congress against bjp. Facebook blocked roughly some 20 crore pages targeting a particular side. Don&#39;t touch politics if you&#39;re not gonna narrate a full story. Nobody liked unseen passages.,
14240,nPrVYCtJfgQ,You are so wrong about Elon buying Twitter. Don&#39;t get your research from western universities and media. They lie lie and lie,
14241,nPrVYCtJfgQ,So someone with 2.7M followers is always right? Not someone who has 5. Also you never explained how Twitter arrived at the magic $8.00?,

You missed a crucial point, Elon has made it clear that he didn&#39;t buy Twitter to make money but only to save free speech. He has 4 other very profitable companies, so your argument that the balance sheet of the company will tank Twitter is utter nonsense. Also, he has proved his credibility to run many successful companies, and his vision of making Twitter the everything app has great potential.",
14252,nPrVYCtJfgQ,Sorry but you&#39;re wrong. Twitter is far better and entertaining since Elon took over.,
14253,nPrVYCtJfgQ,@ThinkSchool have you gone through the twitter files yet?,
14254,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"I am sorry that you think like this and it shows only how much young people are indoctrinated.<br>None of the companies that you sited pausing their advertising on twitter are good companies they all abuse workers, consumers and the countries where they operate and the only ones profiting are the stock holders. And they infiltrated the social media, as they did with almost all government of the world years ago to abuse further.<br>Free speech is a must for humanity to go further if free speech is stopped then is dark ages again for the next 1000 years.",
14255,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"One mistake he did - not verifying the accounts that go for a blue tick. That&#39;s all I see. Also with free speech, as a human being, if you are not breaking a law, you have the right to say what you want. The internet is just a manifestation of what we are allowed to say in public as a human being. If your voice is more supressed online than face-to-face that makes no sense unless you are being opressed of your rights. Social media is a huge thing, it should not be used to supress political and even controversial views.....today&#39;s controversy may become the truth tomorrow. Just like with the virus.",

14282,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"I don’t agree with your point about not giving free speech to everyone. Everyone has the right to free speech and your analogy here is a misfit. Speech doesn’t kill people, it’s a medium for someone to express his or her views. Now the accuracy or authenticity of the views expressed can be questioned and validated, but should not be suppressed. 2ndly what was happening on Twitter was suppression of free speech for the “non idiots” as well. It’s just that these “non idiots” had a difference of opinion on things that Twitter believed in or it’s advertisers believed in. Ex covid vaccines. All the views against the vaccination was suppressed and many renowned doctors and biologists voice was suppressed.",

Easy to say that obviously it is the other human and not ‘think school’. But what happens in real life …. The start of discrimination is the very ability of human deciding if another is a monkey or not.",

14342,SGpTBKbGcQ8,China owns something like 14% of Srilankan loans. Its the west and the IMF and other companies in US like Blackrock so its propaganda about China’s debt trap. China paedoned 17 African countries debt. Which western countries has done that and more so the west has always taken advantage the reason we have terrorism today is because of what US did. China does not have a military bases in any country. So do not blame China for all the teouble of Pakistan.,

Unfortunately Pakistan is still stuck in a time warp, no freedom for the females and imposing laws based on their religious beliefs which falls short of mechanism to manage a modern economy and to keep up wit a fast moving world. Dumb enough to get involved with America&#39;s proxy wars. No doubt the big bucks they received went straight into the pockets of the corrupt govt officials. From all accounts of dubious past, PAKISTAN is not a suitable name for the country. Ain&#39;t nothing pak about the countrymen.   Dodgestan comes to mind. IMO, it is a more appropriate name.",

14422,cXFn7FBgktA,Good job explaining 2008 economic crisis and its comparison to current credit Suise debacle,
14423,cXFn7FBgktA,"Can you elaborate on more the CDS spread, higher the risk.. if the spread is more the insurance companies are getting more money to cover the default right?",
14424,cXFn7FBgktA,Your analysis is excellent. Thank you.,

14428,cXFn7FBgktA,Why? That is the result of west always interfer always intervene the inter al affairs of other countries particularly Asian countries or Asia in general now it back fires of what west doinng now and then so no wonder so make more sanctions against russia against china against other asian countries that are not  puppets of the west countries you cannot dictate you cannot hold the neck of those countries like russia north korea   china and morw,

14442,cXFn7FBgktA,"I have my doubts about this financial crisis.  Yeah, inflation is high, so what, generally is a product of a lot of money floating around.  So the complains about Bank collapsing, etc, smells like government schemes.  Are they taking a chunk of our money to pay for what they are spending funding the war in Ukraine?  Our companies are making money like never before, so why are stocks down? Are there stocks/funds to deceive our consumers?  Hummm... Are we being taken for fools. Nothing makes sense.",

14446,cXFn7FBgktA,"Wow, another impactful episode. One quick question, when banks give loans, they obviously take something as guarantee/pledge/mortgage, then why can&#39;t the insurance companies forfeit these assets from money borrowers and pay to the bank?? Whole catastrophic chain will stop then and there itself",
14447,cXFn7FBgktA,Thank you very much for your in-depth analysis!,
14448,cXFn7FBgktA,2008 banking crisis so concisely and clearly explained! 👌🙏🙂,
14449,cXFn7FBgktA,How can you report on this and can&#39;t pronounce the name of the bank correctly is mind blowing. A global brand name and the presenter cannot get it right.,
14450,cXFn7FBgktA,👍,
14451,cXFn7FBgktA,I have never seen anyone explain 2008 crash soooo well,
14452,cXFn7FBgktA,"Fun fact: the Great Depression in 1930s was far worse than 2008 crisis. It took the stock market around 20 years to get back to the place it was before the depression, while it only took around 2 years after 2008.",

14455,cXFn7FBgktA,"History teaches us that a crash is inevitable. My spouse and I are adding a variety of stocks/ETF to our present holdings and we&#39;ve set asides a good amount to start following inflation-indexed bonds and stocks of companies with solid cash flows. I believe it is a good time to capitalize on the market for long-term gains, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt to know means of actualizing short term profits as well.

14458,cXFn7FBgktA,The madness and incompetence of religious right-wing policy the business model of dictators where they strip money out of the economy and avoid tax and the list goes on.,
14459,cXFn7FBgktA,"The FIRST crisis CS faced was an internal risk management crisis - Greensill and Archegos were disasters, but on top of the executive turmoil, repeated fines and deferred prosecutions for sanctions and tax evasion, were clearly part of a systemic problem. THEN they got the pandemic, war, commodity/energy crises, impending recession etc and were wholly unprepared for them. Is CS too big to fail? Probably. Its AUM is bigger than Swiss annual GDP. But the more important point is one that came out of the LEH bankruptcy, part of the systemic risk is how big the bank is, the other is how interconnected it is to other institutions, ie how many fuses lead to other powderkegs.",

14461,cXFn7FBgktA,"With inflation currently at about 10%, my primary concern in this recession is how to grow my reserve of $240k which has been sitting duck since forever with zero to no gains, sure I&#39;m all in on the long term game, but with my savings are lying waste to inflation and my portfolio losing gains everyday, I need a remedy asap.",
14462,cXFn7FBgktA,"Sorry it’s me again, the world economy is based on banking. And as a result more than 100% of the money is fictitious it’s not based on any physical commodities or any natural resources, ie oil, gold or any other valuable entities.<br>The system is designed for the very few to make money out of the misery of many.<br>Even in the financial meltdown in 2007/8 millions of ordinary working people and businesses lost money.<br>The 2.3 trillion of fictitious money that was lost by many, at least 10% of that was made by a very few. So these Crashes and meltdowns are also a tool designed for the rich, the people at the very top to make money. It’s way of insuring the poor stay poorer and the rich become richer.",
14463,cXFn7FBgktA,"Thank you for your lesson in economics and banking. <br>But the reality is the 2.3 trillion or what ever amount isn’t actually physical money.<br>In every credit crus, the top 1% make money and the rich become richer. Just like during Covid the wealth of the rich went up.<br>The problem is the banking system is designed for people to make money from figures on balance sheet and not actual money or collateral. It’s designed to use the people at the bottom ladder for the people at top to become richer whilst the people they are using are becoming poorer.<br>Until this system of fictional money is replaced by something real, this problem will not go away.<br>This system makes business, banks and other institutions because banks are creating money from thin air, money that doesn’t actually exist, and getting that money insured.<br>The whole system is not only flawed but waited towards the rich and finally it’s totally unfair and dysfunctional.",

14465,cXFn7FBgktA,"To anyone whose paying attention, it&#39;s obvious , the entire world is coming off the rails. Soon we will be evicted and become street eligible. Jay Powell has shown that he’s willing to bring the pain. That means it should peak sooner....I believe that the inflation is already priced in market since the end of last year. What moves can we make to generate more income during quantitative tightening because I can’t afford to see my lifesavings of about $320k turn to dust or being killed by inflation",
14466,cXFn7FBgktA,"OBJECTIVE REALITY IS REAL.<br>A secret society covertly controls the world and they have being doing so for hundreds of years.  Those who belong to that secret society wish to take away our ability to interpret reality objectively.    They  wish us to falsely believe that objective reality does not even exist.   They wish to destroy our ability to think logically because they are attempting to take over the world and enslave us. <br>They have created at least twenty or thirty major hoaxes over the past many hundreds of years.  The following are a list of some but not all of their hoaxes:-   climate change, the spinning ball earth,  space exploration, religious apparations,  near death experiences, demonic possession, poltergeist activity. <br>Before they had brain weapon technology at their disposal they  possibly used magic lanterns and actors to pull off their hoaxes.   Now that brain weapon technology is in widepread use they are able to download  approximately  two thousand different experiences into any human brain which contains what is known as neural lace and they can also download experiences into any part of any human body which contains an intra-body nano-network.  <br>Those of us who are being subjected to wirelessly enabled Remote Neural Monitoring combined with Remote Neural Manipulation  over many years have experiences most if not all aspects of their brain weapon capabilities.   The unwilling subject of Remote Neural Monitoring combined with Remote Neural Manipulation is wirelessly connected  from self-replicating and self-assembling nano technology inside their brain and body to a computerized control system where data is both uploaded and downloaded to and from their brain and body.<br>That unwilling subject is made to hear sounds and voices, to see both still and moving images both in their minds and in locations around them, to feel pain, electric shock and other sensations throughout their bodies, including sexual abuse and they can also be subjected to fabricated smells and tastes.   They can also have their muscles both immobilized and moved against their wills.    Holograms can be made to appear close to them and sounds can be made to appear to come from both inside their heads and from other locations close to them.   They can be locked inside virtual reality holds where sounds, visions, sensations and feelings can all be downloaded into their brains as the same time, making them believe that they are in a heaven or a hell without them being able to realise that they are simply locked inside a virtual reality hold.  Frequency weapons are being used on a selection of individuals which force them to feel emotions which are not naturally being generated by their own brains.   Frequencies of terror were transmitted to me on a continual basis for a period of more than one year.  I was frozen in  fear for that entire year.  Furthermore, another known subject of brain research was locked into the frequency of aggression for a number of months which was so severe that he felt he could not visit his relative during that time due to his extreme feelings of aggression.     Because of these mostly unknown brain and body weapons capabilities,  unknown secret agents have been using them to attempt to make us misinterpret reality.    They have used their brain weapons to create and enhance many and varied hoaxes which have lead to worldwide misunderstandings on a wide scale. <br>In my opinion, the unknown secret agents have also manufactured  mechancial robots of all shapes and sizes which contain nano technology both inside and outside their bodies.   These mechanical robots can be externally wirelessly controlled to walk and talk.  .   They have been presented to members of the public as extra-terresterials and supernatural entities and  as many other creatures. <br>Due to advances in bio-technology, many of us can now be programmed by means of artificial intelligence to arrive at a pre-ordained destination at a precise time.    I was programmed to arrive at my home at precisely 11.11am each morning after being outside taking exercise in spite of that fact that  I did not wear a watch and I took different routes every morning.    Another individual who is unwillingly being subjected to brain research and who has authored many books about brain weapons, known as  Mark M Rich has claimed that a large number of people can be programmed to all arrive at the door of a store at precisely the same time so that some of them may wrongly assume that they are being stalked by the others. <br> Now, that we no longer believe in the many and varied hoaxes which they created for us we are able to interpret reality accurately again and we know without any doubt that objective reality exists now and always has done so.",

14506,r7JPdtYx4sg,The most important thing people should know about &quot;Inflation&quot; is that &quot; Prices DON&#39;T GO UP&quot; ....its actually &quot;Value of Money goes down&quot; ...For Eg: 100 rupees today will buy you less goods than it used to 2 years back.....off coarse banks and govts don&#39;t like that line of thinking..to know more look up and understand how money is created.

14512,r7JPdtYx4sg,"This is so cute. I clicked on the video just to see where Indian policy makers are going wrong. I didnt know it was a clickbait. There are many channels like this with youtube knowledge of how economy works. For them an RBI governor is an idiot and only they know the problems in the economy! There is one problem with this thesis though. This thesis assumes that there will be no increase in salary or income over the entire period of high inflation (the narrator says its high inflation, not logic). Like all the videos in this channel, nothing is researched. The cost of raw materials will also come down when the demand of the finished good itself is low, why will its cost increase when there is no demand of the final finished good, war or not? In addition, there is a question of foreigh reserves too. This channel runs on clickbaits and euphoric music to generate interest. Once the music is muted, his words make no sense",

In reality, people will truly feel proud of their country if it gives them economic prosperity and top quality life. Culture, history and all that crap are secondary and don&#39;t pay the bills. The overproud Indians who brag all over the internet of being proud of being Indian will dash out of India faster than light if they get a foreign visa.

14518,r7JPdtYx4sg,"Why is demand seen as a limiting factor here? Increased demand will get vendors to reduce their profit margins which will be supplemented with the increased demand in market. A company may make a stable profit with higher sales, but just with a lower margin.",

14530,r7JPdtYx4sg,Its soo suprising how most Indian have no knowledge of economical system. I have no interest in politics. Modi or rbi can only control inflation so much... But in the situation such as right now when then world economy is as stable as a river.. the inflation is as same. And i dont think no matter which gov was to be in power right now the crippling inflation was unavoidable,

14533,r7JPdtYx4sg,Nicely explained,
14534,r7JPdtYx4sg,The fact is: STILL houses are getting sold like chocolates in Bengaluru and the market price of Home in Bengaluru is already up by 40% 2022. There is no recession when you see how Bengaluru people are buying cars and homes. I don&#39;t know what to conclude / what data is right or wrong.,
14535,r7JPdtYx4sg,Total reliance on artificial fertilizers should be reduced. Diversification of farming between organic and artificial fertilizers needed. Same goes to energy imports. There was an innovation on use of aluminium cells as battery for cars instead of litium but still no cars annouced with this eventhough aluminium is abundant in india,
14536,r7JPdtYx4sg,"India needs to enforce supply-side policies in order to reduce inflation in the long term.  I know in the short term it is going to have extreme debt for the govt, but it will help in the long term. This is my thinking as an economics student. Anyway, I love your video!! Thank you!",

14540,r7JPdtYx4sg,The title and video are misleading. You just explained the terms and did not even go into details on why rbi is failing to control(likely reacted late like other economies). Even before going into inflation you should&#39;ve explained the money printing that happened due to covid and the supply shock after that. Here we were lucky that India didn&#39;t print money like the US and Europe which is why the inflation was higher in these countries.,

14554,r7JPdtYx4sg,"It’s why Atmanirbhar Bharath is very important to have self sustaining Economy, Infrastructure, Demand,..etc. we don’t need war or anything to do with NATO but still we should suffer the consequences. Mod’s Government has been very resilient and with it’s foreign policies It didn’t bend to the tune of West. All the west, Europe particularly wanted India to stop oil trade with Russia and they didn’t like when Jayashankar pointed fingers towards Europe. Imagine the situation if we stopped oil imports from Russia. Inflation would have been much worse. No wonder why they have released BBC documentary against Modi and BJP govt for the incident happened 2 decades ago.",
14555,r7JPdtYx4sg,"The graph itself is inaccurate. In 1977 , Janta Party came into power after dethroning Congress following the emergency. And since 2014 , we have BJP.",
14556,r7JPdtYx4sg,I always wondered about the inflation and interest rate hike. This video clarified me more than most of the sources in the internet. Thank you!,
14557,r7JPdtYx4sg,Funny is that everyone thinks a politician or a govt is running a country actually it&#39;s people or society who running everything and beyond from Modi to Biden,
14558,r7JPdtYx4sg,Its stinking school..,

14562,r7JPdtYx4sg,Modi government is not failing. He failed 6 yrs before..,
14563,r7JPdtYx4sg,If you heard it properly. Its a supply push inflation... Which is due to corona and war increasing cost of the goods... No government could tackle it... Its not a BJP vs congress issue...,
14564,r7JPdtYx4sg,Nice. Explained in simple understanding way. Thank you.,
14565,r7JPdtYx4sg,India is in better position in the world because of the handling by the current bjp government. Inflation here in Europe is killing common people.,

14576,r7JPdtYx4sg,Your presentation is neither analytical nor is it investigative. It is replete with some examples.,
14577,r7JPdtYx4sg,"When ppl prioritise hindu muslim then inflation, this govt gonna continue even if it fails in many necessary things .",
14578,r7JPdtYx4sg,Yeah you are right look at the God almighty I mean US UK they controlled inflation superb🤣. <br>Some so called case study + nice storytelling style aka communication master style = Expert review. I have studied 0% fy 20-21 GDP forcast paper of Barclays on India. I laughed I keep it as a souvenir of covid times. I am pretty sure you must be laughing too that people think you as an expert though you&#39;ve declared as communication master.,
14579,r7JPdtYx4sg,Rbi is saying that don&#39;t allow the old pension scheme make a video on it,
14580,r7JPdtYx4sg,"Unfortunately the flaw in the system stems with the dollar- which is why India along with some BRICS countries are trying to do . But this is being met with fierce resistance from the US. So before Think School starts out on its anti-India propaganda, it needs to do a lot more research.",
14581,r7JPdtYx4sg,"Another good video simplifying current status. Keep eyes open, don’t be blinded, stay real 🙏🏻",
14582,r7JPdtYx4sg,You should have mentioned that the government has also changed the taxation rules and exempted people having an income below 2.5 lakhs per annum from paying any taxes(so that their monthly expenditures the way you mentioned are not so much affected by the loans and interest rates).,
14583,r7JPdtYx4sg,Over simplify video. Thanks to our youtube baba,
14584,r7JPdtYx4sg,Make video on venuzuela crisis,
14585,r7JPdtYx4sg,you explain things in simple way... Great Work,
14586,r7JPdtYx4sg,"So, you explain the concept of inflation and recession while you title your video why government is failing to control inflation... I feel misleaded viewing this video as there hasn&#39;t been any explanation of why government is failing to control inflation since you in the end say you do not know whether increase in repo rate is good or bad. You already have got people&#39;s attention do not mislead us with these titles as we might lose trust on channel.",
14587,r7JPdtYx4sg,Nice video sirji. Clearly understood everything.,
14588,r7JPdtYx4sg,"Any video on the effect of interest rate hikes/cuts on currency? Because currency weakening and strengthening have an impact on inflation so if u can point to any such relation, would like to know.",
14589,r7JPdtYx4sg,"To those who got confused like me at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7JPdtYx4sg&amp;t=12m24s"">12:24</a> the sentence is supposed to be &quot;the cost of tomatoes is increasing, not because of  there are a lot of tomato buyers....&quot;.

14591,r7JPdtYx4sg,"Precise, accurate .. Not a word wasted .. &amp; density of information + knowledge per second of the video, outstanding.<br><br>A question :<br><br>Does dollar purchase too become a small or big factor contributing to inflation ?<br><br>If we reduce dollar purchase by say 5% every year .. Will it affect (reduce) the volatility in inflation ? .. &amp; if it does so, then by how much ?<br><br>Thanks again, &amp; hope <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thinkschool"">#ThinkSchool</a> or others here help with answers.",

Canada and Germany screwed the turbine issue, therefore, Russia had no choice but shot down NS1. eventually both pipelines were blown up, not by Russia that&#39;s for sure. After 9 consecutive sanctions against Russia, EU heads of the Union went along with America, and screwed its self with the Boomerang, and put the blame on Russia. The heads of EU States should resign for destroying EU and wider economies due to their own stupidity by not seeing America destroying its partners as an example 4X higher prices on LNG. America has played EU on arms supply to Ukraine, now they must buy new arms from America, that is a double whammy. This is how I see it, your opinion  might be  different.",
14709,mDRom6ahzsA,I like your video and there&#39;s a lot of substance of what you said.<br>Only thing you sing too much 😂 and it hard for me to listen to you.<br>I need a scotch after listening to your video.<br>But you are excellent ☺️,
14710,mDRom6ahzsA,"This video is very well made but, Here are some inherent flaws I found in this video.<br>One, it assumes that the energy costs are same everywhere in Europe. That is not the case. It varies in every country. Consequently, not every country needs to give equally high subsidies. This, combined with exceptional warm weather this season made Dutch TTF prices fall below pre invasion levels.<br>Secondly, trade inside European union is not symmetrical. Meaning countries like Greece and Italy are not producing nearly as many goods as countries like Germany, France and Poland. So, they will not and cannot risk the remaining businesses in their country by starting a trade war within European union. And truth be told, most probably all European countries import more from China and rest of the world than they do from each other. <br>And the last point. The debt to gdp ratio was mentioned. Where do you think these countries are getting this debt from? All this debt is coming from European union as a whole and hence Germany is indirectly giving money to other countries such as Greece and Italy by simply being the largest economy in the European union. <br>I would argue that the stability in Europe even after  8 or 9 months of invasion is a proof that countries in European union are actually helping each other in some ways. <br>If you really want to see how bad things can get due to high energy prices look at UK not European union. <br>Maybe this is the reason why not a single prediction made at the end of this video has come true until now. <br>I personally think that if the invasion continues, next winter will be more trying than this one. And that will be true test of the European union.",

14802,py0cfqlhTp8,This is why the citizens have to stop voting for politicians based on nepotism and elect well educated leaders who are actually passionate and determined to build the country as a whole and not just their own houses. Corruption should be treated no less than murders. These local corrupt politicians just keep growing in power along with their own people  while the common people are faced with the consequences. I assume most of the people are youngsters and I request you to vote for the ones that  are indeed devoted to nation building or don&#39;t vote at all.,

Sadly I am not seeing any signs of land labour and judicial/ police reforms in this country, the farm bill was supposed to make our agri sector much more productive, and it was scuttled.

14900,OKQDst5GUc0,"We have seen a lot of questions in the comments section of this video. Here are the answers to the major ones:<br><br><br> <br>1. It’s difficult to control the urge to purchase for things I want. How is Multipl useful then?<br>Ans: Start using Multipl for things which are inherently plannable. Eg:, Insurance premium that you pay once every year, or birthday/anniversary gift that you can give on a specific day only. Holidays can also be planned.<br> <br> <br>2. Market Investments don’t come with any guarantee of returns. What If I lose money on my travel goal in 6 months?<br>Ans: Yes, there’s a certain degree of risk with all market-linked investments.<br><br>What Multipl offers in this case are three things:<br>1.  Allocation that are suitable as per your goal duration, your risk profile and the market analysis. They follow the framework of Safety, Liquidity along with Returns.<br>2. Rebalancing when needed: They constantly monitor your allocated portfolio and rebalance to minimize losses if the market fluctuates significantly.<br>3. Purchase protection: If at the end of your goal, you choose to make a purchase with their brand partners. So let’s say that your 6 months travel goal generates some loss in returns, they’ll match it up to your principal in the form of brand savings if you go ahead and make the purchase with the brand.<br><br> <br> <br>3. How is Multipl trying to defeat delayed gratification and build a positive habit in its users?<br>Ans. Typically, people go for BNPLs despite having money to buy things is because of two reasons:<br>1. Offers <br>2. Rewards<br>Multipl has partnered with brands which gives GiftCards that can be used over and above their native offers. Wisely combined with native offers and bank offers, one can get maximum savings on these brands.<br>Secondly, they have a point system (called MBits) where you get rewarded for saving (just like you get rewarded for spending in credit cards).<br> <br> <br>4. Multipl’s business model. <br>Explained in timestamp 11.47 mins<br><br>5. Does Multipl make money out of mutual fund investments?<br>No. They only give direct mutual funds, which are by definition commission-free. <br>Moreover, Multipl does not charge a promotional fee to any AMC as they are SEBI Registered Advisors, which means they cannot promote one fund over another. <br><br>6. Will this SNBL model work?<br>Ans. Only time will tell. Multipl claims to have 300K+ installs and goals worth Rs 400 Cr+ already created on their app. That speaks volumes. <br>However, people who really want to get the best of this model will do so – earning returns + brand savings + rewards and going debt free at the same time!<br> <br>7. Can you encash your goals earlier?<br>Multipl mentions that there is no lock-in, no penalties. So yes, you can. However, do remember that market conditions should be favourable for you so that you don’t lose money when you sell your units.<br> <br>8. Details about MCash. T&amp;Cs and more. <br>Please check the app for every individual brand detail.",
14901,OKQDst5GUc0,Bs bs hadd se jada krdiye ho promotion,
14902,OKQDst5GUc0,What about taxes? Since the money is saved in mutual funds so for 6 months stcg will apply right?,
14903,OKQDst5GUc0,I am just 21 and i own more than 10 credit cards and so many pre approved loan offer and so many bnpl apps have provided me great credit limits that too without any income verification but i know how to use my cards and my limit properly and bnpl apps like slice lazypay postpe flipkart pay later amazon pay later mobikwik zip helped me to build my cibil which helped me to get pre approved credit cards and loan offers ... basically BNPL like slice and lazypay were best in market when used in discipline and for building cibil without paying any interest 🙂,
14904,OKQDst5GUc0,😂😂😂 what a way to promote another app ….,
14905,OKQDst5GUc0,Why do I need this new SIP based companies? I can do the same thing  myself by saving investing and then shop for best deals.

14915,OKQDst5GUc0,The only problem here is our investment is spent on our liabilities rather than our assets. There would still be a regrets while spending on trips while using SNPL scheme meanwhile it&#39;s a great opportunity for students who want to save money for their higher education.,

14930,OKQDst5GUc0,Why would I use multipl for SIP to buy mutual fund units when I can do this manually( through any other broker)?<br>How is this different from just another investment instrument?,
14931,OKQDst5GUc0,"There literally no advantage of having access to small ticket loans. Just use cash or UPI payments. It is true that the markets do expand if you give access to credit, but it is at the expense of the consumer. No one needs 18000 rupees worth Jordan shoes, no one. Especially someone who earns only 50k per month.",
14932,OKQDst5GUc0,The main reason why BNPL works is because people are trigger happy. Asking a BNPL customer to become SNPL customer is basically asking the person to change himself/herself. It&#39;s not practical.,

14951,OKQDst5GUc0,Good topic superb bro,
14952,OKQDst5GUc0,People are being taken for a ride by Think School. They make money off of you when you click on their videos. Their content is mostly thrash and misleading.,
14953,OKQDst5GUc0,"Why are people buying shoes worth 18k if their take home salary is less than 1 lac per annum. It just doesn’t make any financial sense. There are so many good shoes in 3-6k price bracket. Time stamp at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKQDst5GUc0&amp;t=5m00s"">5:00</a>",

14982,OKQDst5GUc0,The only problem with SNPL is that people say who&#39;s gonna wait that long. And that human tendency is the biggest hurdle... If everybody learned this discipline then many businesses would stop 😂 so ita actually good in way to keep the economy running,

14989,OKQDst5GUc0,I generally love your videos...but perhaps for this first time I felt this video was extremely commercially minded....the video could have possibly included multiple ways to a better financial discipline or atleast provide alternate options of SNPL which are risk free such as the Iwish goal based RD offered by ICICI or equivalent by other banks,

14991,OKQDst5GUc0,great!,
14992,OKQDst5GUc0,"Since @think school is talking about being responsible, i just want to point them out about Wintwealth. If they did a bit of deep diving before endorsing such financial tools, they would have found out about a lot of things, in wintwealths investment strategy,  that arent so good for their investors. In fact, though they market themselves as secure investment option, nothing is secure about them. And think school team should remember that, though they dont promote themselves as financial influencers, they do influence the decision making of a lot of youngsters. A little more background checking, next time onwards, wont hurt anybody.",

15010,7QOLDRY_Uk4,Be better if Indigo Air had more respect for. The new recruits. You let them use the services to get home book flights back to Delhi.but when time to come back sell their seat to someone else with more cash. Strand them in an air port to fend for themselves. How is that good business. If you don&#39;t take care of you employees why should they give their all back to a company where money is more important the their employees security? Right now Indigo Air is the last air line I would trust with my safety. I&#39; d pay a bit more to the competition if they guarantee my safety and that of their air and ground crews,
15011,7QOLDRY_Uk4,Hub and spook model how does it work? If a person has to go from Delhi to Chennai. If Hub is say Nagpur . People would not opt to change flight as it would be waste of time,

15015,7QOLDRY_Uk4,Almost every US domestic airlines never give food on the flight. They only provide little leg space and no entertainment. The ticket price remains between 80-120 USD. Indigo follows the same strategy for the Indian market. Indian market is much more cost sensitive. It&#39;s a good decision.,
15016,7QOLDRY_Uk4,I have heard that Indigo employs female flight crew as opposed to male crew which brings down the weight of the flight by atleast 50 kgs. Saves fuel in the long run. Also the crew collects the trash even before the plane touches down leading to faster turn around...,

Both Airlines, those based in India and Europe and North America charge the same for tickets on a given sector.  So the Manpower Cost for a  Europe or America based carrier is far more than the Carriers based in India.  But, still while Airlines in India have mounting losses, the European and North American airlines are either breaking even or making a Profit.  And the bottom-line for this is the cost of ATF and Airport Terminal Charges in India.  ATF in India costs 20% to 45% more than most countries.",

Jet had A330 and 777 as their widebody long hauls, Kingfisher had Vistara has 737 and 320s in its fleet.

15290,WCJQ2PhzEOM,"A small but close-to-life example. Covid badly impacted many including Vegetable vendors too, as neither could they come to societies nor people were willing to step out. One of the Vegetable vendor near our home started Home-delivery (This may be common in urban areas but wasn&#39;t in our location). And within months, he became the only vegetable vendor our entire area had. <br><br>Now, this vendor has always been there, even pre-COVID but we never bought from him as though nice quality - his prices were a bit high compared to others but since others couldn&#39;t adapt to the paradigm shift and he did, we all now only buy from him as he delivers at door-step and this convenience he provided realizing the opportunity was his success.  <br><br>He now has 6 delivery persons hired. And while due to busy orders, his phone was always busy for calls, he also started taking orders on Whatsapp! While it may sound &#39;so-what&#39; to many, this aged guy, hardly knew how to use smart-phone before Covid so that&#39;s amazing.",

15328,IxIi1xTx8zc,Is thumbnail caption taken from ‘Person of Interest’ ?,
15329,IxIi1xTx8zc,The fact that all your other videos have so many views... While this important one has a few views shows that maybe the algorithm is itself manipulating us and not showing this video. Thanks for making this video.,
15330,IxIi1xTx8zc,"Thanks so much sir, really needed this video to understand the data sharing and privacy issues. <br>Additionally, could you please make a video on Artificial Intelligence, data science, machine learning and big data.

This comment was just me trying to THINK 😄.",
15344,IxIi1xTx8zc,"Social media can actually control us in real life, i had a personal experience. <br>I was a kind of guy who was never into politics, I didn&#39;t even knew the names of many leaders. But when i created an account on Twitter, at the begining everything was normal, but slowly it started filling my mind with political toxicity, i stated arguing with my friend &amp; family because of different political beliefs. I became crazy, arguing with strangers on the internet. <br>But i decided to deactivate my Twitter account and created a new google account for YouTube, as old one was full of political content.<br><br>Now I&#39;m glad that i stopped all those dumb things and removed political toxicity from my mind. Now i mostly focus on my studies and living better life.<br>This was my story how Social media can control our real life actions!",
15345,IxIi1xTx8zc,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxIi1xTx8zc&amp;t=03m20s"">03:20</a> The outrage was because they were not clearing the place in Delhi n also the ones who had already returned to different states weren&#39;t coming out in open to get tested...<br>Later part , where their misbehaviour did happen in hospitals need no explanation..",
15346,IxIi1xTx8zc,"A stupid tik tok channel , a song channel or a roasting channel has millions of followers <br>but people like you who are actually creating awareness and creative thinking abilities has just few thousands shows why our great country has a long a way to go 🚶",
15347,IxIi1xTx8zc,But data collection is important to generate revenue - Facebook has acquired WhatsApp for $ 21Billion - this data collection was bound to happen - in-fact I think Facebook was collecting data before hand and now because fb wants to monetize Whatsapp it made data collection policy public.,

15368,IxIi1xTx8zc,"The solution is ver simple my fellow brothers have a sense of rationalism, a sense to question the content that is being shown or watched. NEVER BELIEVE THAT BLINDLY, have your own micro research and develop an individual notion and not try to impose it on others cuz that&#39;s when you become toxic. Male your own approach and viewpoint and keep it to urself and try to just explain it in a healthy debate among your friends, parents etc.",

15379,IxIi1xTx8zc,Agrred with those viral tiktok videos but <br>The news about Tablighi jamaat was true... because the police said that some of those ppl were hiding intentionally (phones were off) when the police and health workers were trying to tress them for quarantine and that&#39;s what led to more spread of virus.,

15389,IxIi1xTx8zc,WhatsApp used share data to other applications from long back some time not it&#39;s just asking ur permission,
15390,IxIi1xTx8zc,People who knows about the data security and privacy will not easily get influenced by the contents of social media. But whatsapp and Facebook has a billions of users who don&#39;t understand all these technical sides and they will continue using the platform because they are used to it. People will switch from whatsapp only if there is no whatsapp and I don&#39;t think that is gonna happen anytime soon.,
15391,IxIi1xTx8zc,Good job!<br>Definitely an eye opener<br>Hope such issues are solved,
15392,IxIi1xTx8zc,Sir what if  someone hasn&#39;t made account on facebook?,
15393,IxIi1xTx8zc,Amazing one.. 👍👍 <br>But you know that the coming generations will be more loaded to this internet and social media..How we can make them aware of the same.. ? What is the permanent solution for this.? It is going to be big and bigger.. but wish It could get less and minimal..🤞🤞,

15601,NM-WadrQqWE,Indian leaders are living on curruption and they like it.<br>See their records.<br>40K crore digested by Videocon company.<br>14K crore by Nirav Modi.<br>11 K crore by Vijay Malya.<br>And all are living happily in Europe.<br>They were declared. Others may still in hiding. And government of India is happy with this.<br>    In the Note bandi many thousands crore caught by E D . What happened about that money. Because from where they caught that person is saying it&#39;s not his money then whose it is.<br>    Basterds can never improve !,
15602,NM-WadrQqWE,"But in India,  to get my check cleared it takes me more than 3 hours in the bank.  I haven&#39;t got a 2 wheeler or 4 wheeler license since 32 years, or a voter ID card or covid vaccine etc. Do you now see how poverty is caused &amp; sustained in India.  What makes you think that poverty will get less in India??!!!",

15605,NM-WadrQqWE,This video has aged like milk 😂… cardano has lost 80% of its value in 1 year. Imaging pumping public money into this one crypto… might as well given away the money for free.

15611,NM-WadrQqWE,"this talk is doomed to go in vain. there is no one miracle solution to poverty. Poverty is a deep rooted economic and social and culture problem that needs every bit of efforts that the whole society has to alleviate. So the question is: does Indians as a country care about its poor people, truly care so that they are ready to pour in valuable resources to help them, from kid nutrition, to education, to creating jobs with dedicated skill training, and building infrastructure for them that you know that will loose money. Without all these, poverty alleviation will happen, but slowly and slowly. If you really interested in poverty alleviation, you should look into how the Chinese community party did in the past 10 years - that is a human level epic project.",

15630,NM-WadrQqWE,"Ya, because they are worried for a loan of 1 lakh rupees but not thousands of lakhs of rupees 🙏",
15631,NM-WadrQqWE,"The Banking system in India is still not catering to those who actually need it. I’ll site my own example. In 2015, after I completed my post graduation, I needed loan to open my own clinic. The loan wasn’t so big that the Bank had to fear a default, around 12 lacs! <br>Now I was a fresh pass out from my residency. I had no income tax history. The Banks like SBI advertised that for doctor they are providing doctors loan of Rs 35 lacs without any collateral guarantee!! Now when I went to the Bank, I did all my paper work, submitted everything that was required . The banks never called me back on their own. For next 12 months I kept going to bank visiting the bank manager, who kept giving excuses that it’s stuck in higher center, sometimes they would say one more document is required which the forgot … now in the meanwhile one of their criteria for loan was that I should have a valid rent agreement for my clinic premises. Now I had rented a place for the clinic for that purpose. Now imaging for next 12 months I did not get the loan to start the clinic. But I paid monthly rent of the space without generating any income!! . So I paid rent for 12 months. After more than 12 months. I filed my first income tax file. When I submitted that. Only then My loan was granted!! So you see, even though the advertisement we’re given for loan without any income proof, but the final decision lies on the branch manager. If one does not the branch manager well, or branch manager does not have confidence in you, you will not get the loan. Now after 8 years of practice, the bank managers keep calling me or come physically to my clinic asking me if I have any requirements. The fact that I am a safe client, they are now more than willing!!! This is the story of Indian Banking system!!! It caters to those who have money and want to earn more money!!! But not for those who are in lower income bracket and want to uplift their finances",

Now it has become just another channel pumping out &quot;content&quot;, exploiting nativity of our dumb crowd and literally making no sense.

Most expensive brands and luxury items that rich people spend billions on has to be created by the poor in some way",
15645,NM-WadrQqWE,"I think Indian government is doing this like  43 crore new bank account after NDA government arrival - jan dhan account, (. and this accounts save lakhs of crore rupees of India every year in fertilizer, farmer 6000rs, vidhva , vradh, divyang pension and free money during covid) , internet connectivity and internet banking in india now become so common that in metropolitan cities a vegetable seller even fruit seller, rickshawala , maid has Paytm, and in village also by new technology of sms banking without internet by dabba mobile this will change Indian village banking. , Third is connecting adhar with account for verification making easily ( and in future all I&#39;d proof from voter to pan to health Card to diving license to other things all with be connected to a single number most probably adhar , I hope property will also) , fourth is 6000 rs to almost every farmer ( nearly 9+ crore farmer out of 14 crore) for small daily agriculture things, and.35 crore loana to various msme , various life insurance, elder age insurance policies,  and literally negligible tax for lower income for house and even lakh lakh rupees free to make homes,. and I am not sure but government maybe using data from UPI to make credibility ranking, only thing left is vey very small loan for any work but government giving it in specific work  , example small loan in mudra yojna, small loan by kisan credit card from 10,000-50 thousand with minimal interest ( 2.5 crore farmers 17percent of total has this card) , 6000 to every farmer, CGFSEL loan in merely 2 percent interst , student credit card with maximum limit of 15000rs. ( I think only students credit card scheme is not popular otherwise all other schemes are promoting and adopting by people quickly) sometimes we need money not for only small education expenses or agriculture expense or small health expenses but in home other works also which are not specify and we don&#39;t have small loan for these otherwise from education to agriculture to health to buisness government is giving credit card for small loans to big big loans also so indian government is doing well than expected very well",

Especially true for North India.<br>Once they have achieved a certain position, be it business or in education, they easily lose motivation to improve. E.g. Hotels in Indian tourist location charge prices higher than Thailand or Malaysia, and at par with Southern Europe, but still have usual problems found in Indian service businesses, like disorder and lack of accountability. <br>Likewise, Indians spend 12 years slogging English, that too often with private tuition, but their overall proficiency is far worse than Eastern Europe or former Soviet Nations.",

15651,NM-WadrQqWE,"I think here the definition of poor is important, the example assumes that the basic education has been in place first. These examples illustrate people in difficult/ neck to neck  financial condition but it does not reflect the poor of the country. Also the example assumes people in big cities with access to job market. The real situation is however, very different. <br>First the country has to be seen at two layers of urban and rural India, because I do not think the situations faced by residents in either are similar. Then there are layers in both of India&#39;s, layers of poverty and mind that both India would have substantially different layers as the living expenses and potential opportunities are different. <br>Using this as a base, maybe you guys should do this video again. I wish ending poverty was this easy but in the end, it&#39;s all about creating opportunities for people to develop into. As an example, this ITI trainings started by predecessor govt, were amazing tools for people to acquire skills. Probably we need schemes like these to also enter various layers and mind it again, they cannot be the same for all layers.",

15787,jGT6ob8hV6M,What Asian paints bought was a mainframe and not a supercomputer. But still buying a mainframe in 70s is remarkable for an Indian company. Considering the lethargic approach to modernisation by most of the companies of that era barring a few. Let’s not forget even in 2022  (50 years later) the govt office still run everything on paper based files.,

15802,fTuVWwTQegQ,But Zomato is not focusing on cloud kitchen rather it&#39;s focusing on hyperpure more.,

15804,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Does anyone else think we are over hyping the data in the long run? <br>cz I think data has this incredible ability to read people better than themselves, so it does help the business.

We should not at least let that happen.",
15805,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Hi, <br><br><br>I am going to highlight a thing at which nobody so far has noticed. It’s about ethical turned unethical practices of a Indian reputed firm so called “Zomato”. The era of food delivery at home started around a decade ago which soon started becoming popular among one an all eventually and now almost is a name on each and everybody’s mouth. Myself, also being a very big foodie started availing Zomato’s delivery service sitting home which was an awesome experience in starting years. Food delivery those days was costing not much expensive. Zomato’s surcharges from their partner restaurant which usually includes commission, tax on commission, and other minor charges which cumulatively summed up t0 17-19 % in till the years of 2019-20. Then pandemic changed everything and spared not business / person however It’s Zomato who fed every needy individual while sitting at home. This model was very much appreciated during those days and it was hugely considered by everyone that Zomato is the future of the outside food but nobody then knew the dark truth to be come in time to come. <br><br>Before all this story I would like to introduce myself briefly. I’m 36 years old individual qualified as a Chemical Engineer with working experience of 10+ years. My last jobs were with reputed companies i.e. JSW group, Toranagallu, Karnataka (Epsilon Carbon) and Tata Chemicals, Mithapur Salt plant (through third party) and my last drawn salary was 9.36 Lakh per annum. After a long span of living a family life in these remote areas and meanwhile pandemic effects on job market made me awake to enter into cloud kitchen business which used to be my passion. I took a huge risk leaving my job aside and started a cloud kitchen after trying for around 8-9 months. I had no lack of passion and was not at all scared of hard work. I was very much confident about my abilities and experience which I assumed will help me grow in the business. Zomato for me then was just you, I or anyone else know about.<br><br>My online food selling business started in May 2022 after documental formalities. Till that date, Zomato’s commission (including everything) officially was rose to 27% which is a lion’s share in profit. When we talk about eateries (restaurants, food stalls, street food stalls, Thelewala), 70% of the business even don’t manage to earn (say take home wages) this much amount to their home (27%). <br><br>Now the story comes to Zomato. <br><br>Earlier we used to go outside physically at restaurant to have our food whenever we wanted to do. Zomato eventually changed the picture and made things easy. Although, people merely experienced when their meal plate became costlier like anything in very short time span. Due to this Zomato’s huge commission restaurants started hiking their price by 30-35% which was substantial amount in this short period. A person who was getting average meal for say i.e. at INR 150 + taxes + delivery charge) which may be approximate INR 175,  he started getting the same food Rs. 250 or even more. <br><br>If restaurant tries to maintain the hiked price to make sale balanced, he falls in great loss. <br><br>27% commission and taxes too just a myth. Restaurant encourages or simply speaking blackmails restaurants to do participate in promotional programmes which are chargeable schemes. It means if restaurants don’t participate in programmes, their visibility on Zomato app will be as poor as that restaurant will hardly get a couple of orders in a day. Now the actual expenditure on Zomato ad comes into picture. They have customized many plans and schemes to be opted by restaurant partners. Big daddys in restaurant business can afford and select high package schemes whereas even a ordinary package is costlier for a common food service provider though no option left but to go with ad scheme. It indirectly adds an additional average 5%  load of 27% discount summing it to 33%. <br><br>The story doesn’t even end here. Unethical practices from Zomato leave the businessmen in no way unturned to earn his bread and butter. Every now and then, Zomato sends a mail to their restaurant partners that they are starting a campaign where restaurant’s visibility will be made higher on Zomato food delivery app for which they have to opt for their scheme in which restaurant has to provide a discount to customer. This discounted amount is completely borne by restaurant however Zomato never highlights the same and takes all the credit of discount by Zomato itself from customers. A dirty reality is that customer always thinks that the discount being offered is by Zomato but not by restaurant. I some case if under-priced food, any complaint is raised by customer which comes in the form of review / ratings which directly affect restaurant’s overall image and rating. However up to this it’s fine but in some cases spam ratings also take place for which Zomato never let restaurant speak directly to customer due to which their probability of making the repeated mistake can be nullified.<br><br>As mentioned above, these promotional campaign sometimes are imposed without authorization of restaurant. Restaurant comes to know on this when a lot of orders are already gone. These discount promos are operated by Zomato itself hence can’t be stopped by self. It takes 2-3 days after your complaint to get the promo offer stopped. Till the same time, you have no other option left with you to do. First is to turning the restaurant off on Zomato (which negatively impacts the image of restaurant on customers) and other is to bear the losses of unauthorized discounts (unwillingly but only to show the restaurant open). Due to policies made by Zomato, if we reject the order in this case, visibility of restaurant becomes so poor that restaurant may not receive new customer orders for couple of days. This thing has been experienced by me 4-5 times in last few months, and subsequently Zomato has not compensated for losses anytime or eben not bothered to revert on raised tickets.<br><br>Next point is that Zomato is so unethical that many restaurant which are getting continuous negative rating however managed to maintain the restaurant rating as 4+ on app. It doesn’t apply for common restaurants who are not capable to pay heft ransom in form of paid ads. Zomato doesn’t share its algorithm methodology (confidential as per Zomato) which they use for restaurant’s overall rating calculation and on the basis of same they are not all bothered to answer your restaurant’s rating improvement. Overall rating on Zomato is a main factor depending upon which the sales is dependant. I tried no stone unturned to improve my retuarant’s rating by getting maximum 5 stars however failed to improve because Zomato is not all bothered to answer.<br><br>Each and every query is raised in form of tickets to Zomato. Its replied with customized and computerized mails and tickets are closed furher. There is no direct telephonic link to talk to Zomato anytime in <a href=""http://need.in/"">need.In</a> this case we feel nothing but helpless. <br><br>8 out of 10 restaurants are being closing every year but now I came to know that 4 of them are deserving but are victims of business based corruption say monopolization / duopolization.<br><br>Surprisingly, there is no proper authority is controlling these firm. This is directly affecting consumers. The days are not far when food will not be in plates. It will be in small bowls. <br><br>The above content is a brief article that I would like to convey to you in hope that it will be highlighted and brought to consumers. The time is not far when Zomato will be a modern franchise version of EAST INDIA COMPANY. I’m already at the verge of closing my kitchen but before that I want to let the reality come in everybody’s knowledge.<br><br>Many more things are there which I’m not highlighting in this short mail.<br><br>Support data on my mails can be produced if any action is likely to be taken from your end.<br><br>Lastly, I would only like to say,<br><br><br>SAVE YOUR PLATE.",
15806,fTuVWwTQegQ,By laying off their employees,
15807,fTuVWwTQegQ,Food delivery is not a profitable business unless someone invents teleporting in the next few years. The razor thin margins is not enough to attract investors interest and the same also means small changes in costs can severely flip a profit making company to a loss making one,
15808,fTuVWwTQegQ,Amazon a sissy cheater,
15809,fTuVWwTQegQ,Excellent,
15810,fTuVWwTQegQ,Abbe chal paka mat,
15811,fTuVWwTQegQ,Where is my gold  😜😜<br> just kidding.... You did your best for knowledge,
15812,fTuVWwTQegQ,I was financial controller of kitopi 😀,
15813,fTuVWwTQegQ,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTuVWwTQegQ&amp;t=8m07s"">8:07</a>. this data is incorrect. These ghost kitchens rely on digital mediums to get orders. CAC and AOV matter a lot, and with competition, maintaining them is impossible. And 1 Lakh rupee is nothing for digital marketing. You can only advertise within certain radius.",
15814,fTuVWwTQegQ,Nope 🤣,
15815,fTuVWwTQegQ,Cow dung,
15816,fTuVWwTQegQ,Good work. Well done.,
15817,fTuVWwTQegQ,Nice information brother 👍,
15818,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Still cant agree... The roads in India are worst, the weather conditions are bad and local food chain sellers got a community... They can easily drown Zomato and Swiggy.",
15819,fTuVWwTQegQ,Normal restaurants and hotels well die and sucide only rich will get more rich,
15820,fTuVWwTQegQ,So it&#39;s worth to buy 1000 shares of zomato,
15821,fTuVWwTQegQ,Never ever trust new unicorn going public. These gold mines have now become coal mines and soon it will land mines. Avoid new age public ipo..,
15822,fTuVWwTQegQ,Our business must be ethical like tatas😤,

15824,fTuVWwTQegQ,"In future cloud kitchen will become the biggest failure system in making money, only traditional run system will make profit, this video is 1 year old, still zomato and swiggy are in big loss and cash burning business.",
15825,fTuVWwTQegQ,Best part I&#39;m getting Zomato ad between Zomato video 😂,
15826,fTuVWwTQegQ,Paid video. Have some ethics you fucking sellouts.,
15827,fTuVWwTQegQ,The concept of cloud kitchen and the customer data and its effective use are the key attributes for the success of an enterprise.,
15828,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Zomato squeezing money from delivery partners and many of partners are under strikes on different states ,tamilnadu Kerala etc ,company needs to cooperate with partners otherwise situation becomes worst",
15829,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Zomato squeezing money from delivery partners and many of partners are under strikes on different states ,tamilnadu Kerala etc ,company needs to cooperate with partners otherwise situation becomes worst",
15830,fTuVWwTQegQ,Bought Zomato shares after watching this video. Now I am bankrupt... From 110 to 40 rupees fall ....,
15831,fTuVWwTQegQ,hyperpure analysis...loved it. God Bless your channel and knowledge,
15832,fTuVWwTQegQ,Government has to come up with appropriate Laws to protect small offline business,
15833,fTuVWwTQegQ,YouTube has a nice sense of humour,
15834,fTuVWwTQegQ,I think zomato loses most of its revenue in relentless advertisement.,
15835,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Even if Zomato YOY accumulate losses and at end go to IBC and declaring bankrupt doesn&#39;t affect deepinder Goyal at all because to setup a Zomato like company is not a big deal, it&#39;s assets are merely 100 crores , liquidation will be of only brand name and value, he can very easily setup another food agreegator model company after its delisting. Because whatever he has to earn he earned when he launched IPO and in Blinkkit acquisition which is friends company.",
15836,fTuVWwTQegQ,Zomato share has now fallen 75%. People see these kind of stupid videos and lose their hard earned money. Respect the market. This guy considers himself the smartest person in the world.,
15837,fTuVWwTQegQ,Today zomato traded @41 rs. FunkU.,
15838,fTuVWwTQegQ,Zomato food chain?,
15839,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Zomato investors in 22 be like, this fooool",
15840,fTuVWwTQegQ,Very good video,
15841,fTuVWwTQegQ,really great details man,
15842,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Alexa launched in 2014, curious to know how it was Alexa compatible in 2013 before Alexa even launched.",
15843,fTuVWwTQegQ,a very naive view into the oldest industry of all times,
15844,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Good explanation, but speak slowly and it is more effective.",
15845,fTuVWwTQegQ,"After charging 28% &amp; forcing vendors 15 to 20% as marketing expenses to push an outlet to go up the list, takes no participation in promos, no accountability in failed deliveries, no investments in delivery vehicles, no salaries to delivery ppl, push vendors to offer massive discounts whereby the vendors are actually making a loss on food cost. They still manage to post a loss of 1500 cr. All the money goes towards corporate rent, massive salaries, business class flights at the cost of the vendors.",
15846,fTuVWwTQegQ,So afterall Zomato was not a gold mine investment.. and nor is this guy&#39;s analysis however coherent the story sounds to be,
15847,fTuVWwTQegQ,Watched many video of yours but this video compelled me to subscribe,
15848,fTuVWwTQegQ,Save local street food... 😋,
15849,fTuVWwTQegQ,Thanks!,
15850,fTuVWwTQegQ,Being a restaurant owner zomato and swiggy not profitable for us in short term or long term <br>Discounting culture and highy commission eats into our margin,
15851,fTuVWwTQegQ,Maast rupaiya chaapa hain aise jhut bolwake IPO k samay. Aise paisa kama kae kya karega re. Logo ko bewaja tuneh aise video karwake lalaj dikhaye IPO k tym. Lalchi log phaas gaye 😅. Acha nhi hain,
15852,fTuVWwTQegQ,This Video Aged Very Well 😂 Zomato is otw to become a Penny Stock soon 😂😂 JK but Zomato has lost more than 100% in value,
15853,fTuVWwTQegQ,Currnetly Zomato 📉,
15854,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Zomato can&#39;t make its own kitchen and sell the same biryani sold by behrus. Coz that biryani sold by the name of behrus and not by name &quot;biryani&quot;. Another thing is the recipe and cheff that makes biryani for behrus <br>Sorry if I spelled the name of biryani brand, coz i don&#39;t actually remember the name",
15855,fTuVWwTQegQ,Swiggy killing Zomato very soon,
15856,fTuVWwTQegQ,I stopped booking in ZOMATO. Because the price are 30 percent more than hotel rates,
15857,fTuVWwTQegQ,Feeling sad for those who watched this video about so called SHITMINE zomato and invested in it ..,
15858,fTuVWwTQegQ,What do you think about zomato investing in blinkit. Will it going to be beneficial?,
15859,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Amazon was also cash rich and profitable by the time they started leveraging data while zomato is still taking up debt for operations . Great content though , the parallels with kitopi was perfect.",
15860,fTuVWwTQegQ,I saw zomato ad before starting this video lol,
15861,fTuVWwTQegQ,My friend the so called &#39;Every single expert and fundamental analyst&#39; that you were taunting is right and &#39;You&#39; are wrong about zomato. More than one year on Zomato is still burning invester cash and just getting worse,
15862,fTuVWwTQegQ,note it down. Zomato is never going to be profitable. Any investor buying stocks watching this shit is down 60% or even more. This video came right before IPO. You r just making fool out of people. Its just the game of valuation. Stock market shows u the reality.,
15863,fTuVWwTQegQ,I so want to believe in the Zomato growth story. For the past few weeks I am up-skilling so that I can contribute to Zomato&#39;s journey. But the very fact that the promoters hold 0% shares makes me feel it as a landmine. Do you have any take on this?,
15864,fTuVWwTQegQ,This is conjecturing- In house brands suck and Bed Bath Beyond is the latest victim to this. We all know these in house products are not the same as brand ones,
15865,fTuVWwTQegQ,Everyone knows how zomato will become profitable except the management of zomato.,
15866,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Maybe it’s not a GOLD MINE. I have lost trust on any of the recent IPOs cause all are just burning money given by VC to increase valuation, go public and dump it all on naive retailers :)",
15867,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Amazon has practically monopoly over ecommerce. Zomato doesn&#39;t over cloud kitchen. Data alone doesn&#39;t makes investment opportunity. Making proper utilisation is. Frankly ordering from Zomato is extremely expensive than ordering directly from the restaurant. With lockdown no longer factor, dining directly at restaurant is better than ordering.",
15868,fTuVWwTQegQ,I look i laugh nkw,
15869,fTuVWwTQegQ,"2 mins silence for those, who believed it 🤣😂",
15870,fTuVWwTQegQ,🤣😂😂,
15871,fTuVWwTQegQ,Will go to single figure,
15872,fTuVWwTQegQ,This did not age well,
15873,fTuVWwTQegQ,This did not age well,
15874,fTuVWwTQegQ,Plot twist - People are going to be most health conscious so they will eat home made food,
15875,fTuVWwTQegQ,"While I agree with you on most points, product and food are not the same. People go to restaurants for the experience as well.",
15876,fTuVWwTQegQ,It is not easy to copy the food compared electronic items..in food people need variety nobody orders from same place every day..everyone needs different food and different brand .even if Zomato copies the food and taste it will be branded as Zomato food not McDonald&#39;s or KFC or any other restaurants,
15877,fTuVWwTQegQ,But the stock prices are saying otherwise,
15878,fTuVWwTQegQ,Rebel foods be like:- ya toh dhandha band karwadega😂,
15879,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Dude, your analysis is absolutely incredible. It&#39;s a gold mine, no pun intended.",
15880,fTuVWwTQegQ,Zomato and Swiggy charges anywhere in the range of 20 to 40% to the restaurant owners...cost ia being passed on to the customer... You can already see there is huge cost difference between the home order and when you visit restaurant... I have already reduced my orders online for two reasons... One it&#39;s expensive to eat at home and you don&#39;t have feeling of restaurant food... Amazon is still not able to make decent ac or tv (see their rating in Amazon itself) forget about indian food quality... We can&#39;t make food homogeneous..,
15881,fTuVWwTQegQ,Thank you man.,
15882,fTuVWwTQegQ,This video shows that you have just bookish knowledge,
15883,fTuVWwTQegQ,you are promoting zomato ipo. you should not do it. it is not ethical,
15884,fTuVWwTQegQ,Here after Zomato acquired Blinkit. This video aged well. 😁 That is why always do your own research.,
15885,fTuVWwTQegQ,Imagine if you own a profitable restaurant or any business for almost 10 years and suddenly the landlord kicks you out and he runs the same business with a different name. <br>Not all have some ethics like Tata.  Some new regulations in this will help a lot of SMEs.,
15886,fTuVWwTQegQ,Dislikes from swigy,
15887,fTuVWwTQegQ,Make a video on zomato vs swiggy,
15888,fTuVWwTQegQ,Waching this video in June 2022...Zomato&#39;s tock price became half compared to last year...,
15889,fTuVWwTQegQ,Garbage,
15890,fTuVWwTQegQ,"That is product and this is food taste matters, I have ordered from almost all the restaurants in my city, brands you have mentioned fasoos and behrooz super suck in taste behrooz actually has the audacity to deliver semi cooked meat!! Fasoos their rolls goddamn!! Quarter baked roti bases it&#39;s eww!!",
15891,fTuVWwTQegQ,very good narration bhai... really very informative.. your video is a gold inside the junkvides across youtube.. thanks for the efforts,
15892,fTuVWwTQegQ,Hehe,
15893,fTuVWwTQegQ,I was following Think school until this video. Zomato is a gold mine??? They dont have P/E ratio closer to even high risk stocks. Biased video,
15894,fTuVWwTQegQ,"I am no expert <br>But look at zomatos performance ,it&#39;s share price is languishing &amp; retail investors have lost their value<br>Your analysis is good , no doubt<br>But all it matters is execution",
15895,fTuVWwTQegQ,Chutiya company. I use it every 2 days but it is a chutiya loss making company. It will not exist by next year.,
15896,fTuVWwTQegQ,What&#39;s zomato&#39;s price on sensex,

15916,6GWm2OyekXY,Great man <br>No one talks about real things nowadays everyone keep talking about this shitty philosophy don&#39;t sleep until you get success work 18 hrs a day and the truth is there is no need to work 18 hrs a day (exceptions may exist) You can work 7-8 hrs a day and that&#39;s more than enough When you work 18 hrs a day then quality of your work decreases exponentially and it can also lead to extreme burnout Work 7-8 hrs  a day and never stop enjoying life <br>Suffering is directly proportional to Success This is shit philosophy,

15918,6GWm2OyekXY,"Also hardwork doesn&#39;t equate success, if that was the case then the hardworking labourers would be the richest. So all around, hustle culture is just bullshit, doesn&#39;t matter which way you look at it.",

They never copy someone schedule that this person wake up at 4 am so i hv to do so. No!. Even Elon Musk wakes up at 7 am. The billionaires adjust their schedule according to their personality not on others will.,
15943,6GWm2OyekXY,You said it right my brother,
15944,6GWm2OyekXY,Then 4AM Thing Could Be Taken As Sleep At 9 &amp; Wake At 4 ?,
15945,6GWm2OyekXY,Career and dreams are just part of ur life not whole life....there r somany things which are already available around us...we need to enjoy them....thats why Warren Buffett lives in a small house.....,
15946,6GWm2OyekXY,The so called motivational pages take the celebritys lifestyle videos add some BGM and get millions of views but a meaningful content doesn&#39;t even reach people <br>People tend to get attracted by flashy things 🤦‍♂,

15955,6GWm2OyekXY,Sleeping is not an optional thingh it&#39;s as vital as taking breath.,
15956,6GWm2OyekXY,"Getting asleep is more difficult than waking up in the morning, when you will wake up depends on when you got asleep, so as a new day starts at 12AM so does our day starts with a timely sleep.",

15975,6GWm2OyekXY,Beautiful,
15976,6GWm2OyekXY,"Absolutely right. I have been always against this philosophy. The very idea of putting your health last for sake of &quot;success&quot; is wrong. And the biggest reason i think is because people aim to be just rich, rather than targeting to affect more and more people positively. Kabhi na kabhi to zarur milunga tumse.",
15977,6GWm2OyekXY,"Dude,<br>Good job with your video content.<br>As you have so many followers, it&#39;s your moral obligation to do your research and present the right content.<br><br>4am hustle means, waking up at 4am not sleeping at 4am.<br>Please correct this mistake.<br>I am reporting this video as false and misleading, but I have best wishes for your effort.",

15992,6GWm2OyekXY,No compromise when it comes to sleep and food.,
15993,6GWm2OyekXY,the topic should be &quot; 4am Hustle is overrated&quot;.  and again that &quot;4 am hustle&quot; is about waking at 4 not sleeping at 4. XD,
15994,6GWm2OyekXY,Want to see your channel with 1M subscribers soon.. tum bht mast kam krta h maqsood bhai..,

16000,t-VpFrqd0W0,"Nice video, the hit of the pandemic has shaking the foundation of how we do things as humans especially socializing. But many sees <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metaverse"">#metaverse</a> as a tool that has the potential to curb some of the challenges that the pandemic brought. Though most of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metaverse"">#metaverse</a> projects on the market now are into gaming and virtual concerts, with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stepapp"">#StepApp</a> pushing the limits of this Tech in the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fitness"">#Fitness</a> industry, it won&#39;t surprise me if <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metaverse"">#metaverse</a> is applied to other aspects of our lives. It&#39;s early days yet, but whether it&#39;s just a hype or the next Tech revolution, we all have to wait and see.",
16001,t-VpFrqd0W0,"But ask yourself, if these screens are going to cause headache would you use it?",
16002,t-VpFrqd0W0,Does think school teaches the mentorship programmes for start-ups?,

16012,t-VpFrqd0W0,Thanku sir for a excellent session 👍,
16013,t-VpFrqd0W0,"Good insight about Metaverse. While out of my curiosity , I have read and listened few other sources about Metaverse - people gave out their imagination how this is going to be used .. <br><br>One among them which I felt amazing is:<br><br>A specialized surgeon who generally visits other places currently occasionally &#39;coz of travelling issue - will be able to contribute now through Metaverse easily. In an operation theatre along with the doctors performing - this surgeon can be present as an avatar - go around 360 degrees to get the exact understanding and guide the performing doctors what need to be done.<br><br>No Technology is good or bad as per me - it&#39;s all about how we make use of it. Same would be with metaverse also.<br><br>I would look forward for a video from you - which talks about possible business opportunities using metaverse .",
16014,t-VpFrqd0W0,Wow the minute you started explaining humans from apes to rulers.. I was reminder of Sapiens.. great job as always Ganesh.. I would love to be a part of your stall at metaverse,
16015,t-VpFrqd0W0,Plz do Fundamental analysis of KPR Mills,
16016,t-VpFrqd0W0,All current tech and social media would become history as soon as it reaches the majority. One of it&#39;s advantages would be kill of social media sites and it&#39;s negative mental effects,
16017,t-VpFrqd0W0,example - Nuclear Power when discovered was first used to create the Atom Bomb not Power Plants....So its always subjective and on us only how we use the knowledge. If we are good people we will for a case like the NGO use case and if we are going bad or run away from reality we become similar to what Surrogates movie showcased,
16018,t-VpFrqd0W0,In India we may end up having Metaverse riots 🙄🙄,
16019,t-VpFrqd0W0,Thanks!,
16020,t-VpFrqd0W0,"all the tech is already present, but are we using it to its full capacity?

16023,t-VpFrqd0W0,Metaverse is just a product to keep you engage with company and do their business.  Your opinion is bias and not showing other/negative side of it.,

16052,t-VpFrqd0W0,Meta Verse is only helpful for specific area.(not for daily use ),
16053,t-VpFrqd0W0,Metaverse  is a waste of time. It will put more and more people indoors which will have a negative affect on the mental and emotional health. Well time will tell how and where this technology will take mankind. Second life was a prime example of such metaverse failure. Just my thoughts.,
16054,t-VpFrqd0W0,"The potential negative consequences far exceed the positive ones. Considering how woefully ill equipped governments are at regulating tech, the negative consequences are going to dominate. Just look at how divided society has become as social media grew in adoption.",
16055,t-VpFrqd0W0,This video gave me a whole new perspective of looking at metaverse. Thankyou think school ❤️,
16056,t-VpFrqd0W0,hence meta will kill your livelihood and u will end up in a virtual world with highly red-colored eyes causing health issues,
16057,t-VpFrqd0W0,What were the fun activities that you had that opened up people for brainstorming?,
16058,t-VpFrqd0W0,"First of all, who the hell are these people who get so much time to waste during office hours? Where do they come from? And By the way, attrition rate is not going to come down because of a virtual world meeting sessions. It depends on factors like money ,work culture etc.. And, a toxic work culture will feel even more toxic in virtual world where senses are high. Your video is good but with wrong analogies. You need to get a real world office job to understand how actually project deliverables happen in office. Your Teaching sessions job is not going to help understand these things.",
16059,t-VpFrqd0W0,I mean like bruh will we need to just live in this world then we wont even know our body and we when we see our selves in the mirror be like who tf? Are you and then to realise that all that we experiencenced was fake just like ready player one,

16076,t-VpFrqd0W0,You do research works which course u have taken?<br>as a result become a excellent way of communicating and passing   the message in simpler way😍.,
16077,t-VpFrqd0W0,"I don&#39;t know why there is so much hype for this metaverse....there are multiplayer games which does the same thing....for example..pubg ,free fire , minecraft, gta....and some of them are available in VR also...these games are much for engaging and enjoyable than this boring metaverse....and these games are not new....So why there is so much hype for this metaverse.... even graphics do not feel real in metaverse.",
16078,t-VpFrqd0W0,what if neura link and meta would collaborate? Then with neuralink technology there would be no need of Oculus and joystick like console for using meta (musk and zuck might bury the hatchet),

He told me that I wasn&#39;t well prepared, how I am thoughtlessly answer the questions and my friend was way better than me and I was a stupid loser. He also accused me for not being tried so hard. I told him that i did my best for the preparation but he didnt buy it at all. He thought i&#39;m lying. He didn&#39;t even listen to my explanation and keep criticizing me. Even though he , me and my friend we all work together for interview preparation and he also knows our skills very well, he didn&#39;t trust me at all. Treat me like I&#39;m a piece trash.  I tried my best and prepared for the past whole week just for the interview. I felt very sad, frustrated, feeling so unfair and no motivation and confidence to take the interview any more. I know everyone makes mistake. I can accept my interview result but his words hurt me too much. I don&#39;t know whether he wants me to improve myself or not. I don&#39;t want to think about it anymore but it&#39;s in my head all the time. 🥺 could you guys pls give me advice what should I do",

16126,fnO6UfeplxE,And they have the audacity to undermine Indian medicine. And a very sad situation we are in is that our own people are undermining our medicine. This I know is because some particular castes in India have locked up the access to the texts and often misinterpreted the science. But now we know the hippocracy of English medicine.,

16170,fnO6UfeplxE,Bro but how to know which is constructive feedback,
16171,fnO6UfeplxE,Brilliant👍,
16172,fnO6UfeplxE,"Any one who has achieved a top position if we look at, they reached there through their talent, handwork and feedback system they built - But, unfortunately what happens is after certain time - the feedback system doesn&#39;t work &#39;as initially - let me put my point through an example<br><br>A famous director who has given 5 block busters .. Imagine how much thought process would have gone into during story finalization, script making, shooting , post production etc., Every time while the director discusses with his feedback channel - initially there is every possibility the channel would be coming out with their views, thoughts, apprehensions towards the decisions taken etc.,<br><br>But as no one know which will work - finally they will be agreeing at some point and in that there would be enough places where they may have not felt fully convinced with the director. But, when they see those areas well accepted by audience and movies become hit one after one - the feedback channel gets to a stage knowingly or unknowingly that the director thought process is right than what they are thinking and they may not be giving feedback in the same way they used to do initially.<br><br>That&#39;s why we see successful directors, leaders, entrepreneurs do commit mistakes at their peak stager. Therefore having a feedback system and refining that every now and then is equally important. <br><br>Nice topic chosen Ganesh... Can you sometime write what inspires you to come out with such topics and how do you actually research to make such informative and engaging consent. Thanks in advance",

16224,ULhoofZmZmg,"True. Alibaba is an experience. It gives pride to Chinese that they could get anything at one place. <br>The margin is very thin and by Jack  Ma himself, they took time by volume to make up the numbers. <br>Also he argued,  the charges were low and the customers and suppliers did not mind paying the transaction charges. <br>Finally eBay and  Alibaba are two different concepts. <br>EBay while based it&#39;s model on arguing or bargaining as the base money spinning spree, Alibaba is a trade portal which had it&#39;s own business dynamics.",

16287,ULhoofZmZmg,I don&#39;t think that the same strategy used by Alibaba can work in India. Though it would have worked in 90s but there was no digitalization and this generation is not that habitual of bargaining and they will surely prefer a cleaner website like Amazon and flipkart.,
16288,ULhoofZmZmg,I still did not get how come a Chinese name his company &quot;Alibaba&quot;.,
16289,ULhoofZmZmg,Great content bro..❤but i think why ebay did not rearrange their website and sruvive?,
16290,ULhoofZmZmg,i am telling you  i have on youtube since 2018 <br>but your channel is THE BEST THING youtube can provide,
16291,ULhoofZmZmg,"And thats the reason alibaba is only famous in china..in the world people wants quality and good products, not a cheap products which lacks quality. If china wants third class products, let them die..World dont think like china..its like if uncivilizd people dont like civilized people products it doesnt mean they oppose permanently, when they got matured automatically they will switch to civillized style, ebay may fail initially but in future if alibaba continues same 3rd class products or website, ebay will defnitly capturs the china market..",

16293,ULhoofZmZmg,"Your viewpoint about Alibaba is only from market research perspective, which I mean of course is mind-boggling, but there are many other factors that contributed to the failure of eBay. <br><br>In countries like India and China, eBay didn&#39;t really have official tie-ups with companies aur koi third party hi products sell ker raha tha products. At times, people were also cheated into getting wrong delivered products. Aur saath saath, the Chinese government had also imposed many terrifs and trade bans due to which to capture an entire market was near to impossible",

16339,B5txS_lC1yY,"I want to quote from Dmart &quot; From the launch of its first store in Powai in 2002, DMart today has a well-established presence in 284 locations across Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, NCR, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Rajasthan. &quot;<br><br><br><br>I can understand your families pain and suffering but your interpretation about 93 does not coincide with the information above, the era of 2002 is way different than 1993.. some of your videos shows over exuberance - &quot; just like any other Indian&quot;. It clearly shows what your agenda is and why do you want that agenda to be portraited. for me a narrative should be close to reality - which your trying hard and i appreciate it.<br><br>To be précises - kirana shops used to give monthly katta and people did not go and buy in Dmart for its pricing and this was a reality. to put petrol in their bikes and scooters for traveling to a place like Dmart were there was no buses during the starting phases of dmart. no one would spend money to go. only the rich classes were target audiences.<br><br>I just want to understand how your getting sponsors - please do a video on that!",
16340,B5txS_lC1yY,Really !!! The chart was of ur family expenses???,
16341,B5txS_lC1yY,There is one more thing to keep in mind. Big multinationals  will not give fast moving items as demanded by kirana stores. THey will give fast moving items and will push slow moving items. ie. If Company X has product a as fast moving item and product b as slow moving. Company will X will give only product a if kirana stores buys product b also. <br>Thus Kirana stores are at dis advantages as their inventory goes up with slow moving items. <br>On the other side Kirana stores also at fault for taking their local customers for granted.,

16361,B5txS_lC1yY,"Your Case study analysis is so Good. I worked in Dmart for 1 year and the topics you&#39;re covered are true without misinformation.  Indeed the dmart offers significant discount by boosting it sales, hence they get more discounts from vendors in regular basis. I would like to add few more points where dmart earns revenue in following areas.<br><br>1) They have private lables which are competitors for high sale product, The dmart either manufacture or market those products and they will be placed those products next to competitive product. ( Ex Mazza- Mango merry, Nescafe - Lecafe, Harpic - Force 10,etc; the products packing are so similar, sometimes even the regular customers can&#39;t differentiate) Since they market/ manufacture this products they are quite cheap compared to the competitive products.<br><br>2) Loose Grocery contributes 23% of daily stores Revenue. Since they obtain the large quantity of Groceries from farmers.( Eliminating the middle men) <br><br>3) Cross Merchandising<br>4) Plastic and glass items are importing from china and rebranding.<br><br><br>Thanks for the wonderful case study Think School, They are so informative..",

But the traffic signals stopped working after it got opened, due to this a lot of accidents started taking place in this area. It is clear that D Mart bribed &quot;someone&quot; to stop this traffic signal so that it will become easier to their customers to take wrong route (if not they have to take a U-turn at next junction which is ~1km).

16522,odiaekxLY0g,"Bajaj Finserv has been in the market as it comes from legendary Bajaj family,  earning the trust of people.  Then the interest where most of NBFCs charge high,  taking cut from manufacturers worked both ways.<br>That was good thinking. Third as data mining showed the risk profile of customers,  it&#39;s easy to take decision.<br>People wanted hassle free credit and bajaj provided it. <br>As alternative to bank loans,  it is finding the gap in credit market. <br>Where do they get funds as it is known tapping the debt market nationally and financing even in rural areas.  It is to be seen how their rural consumer market penetration is. Also their profit from the revenue is smaller compared to Muthoot finance. Internal efficiency is key to sustain market. <br>Now new forms of credit is rising and let&#39;s see how they manage the competition.",

16528,odiaekxLY0g,Is CRED coins useful like credit card points???,
16529,odiaekxLY0g,"Is it wrong to put it like this, that by going ahead in this direction although it is creating a healthy environment at one place but similarly leaving behind/creating/magnifying a large vaccum in another place. I also guess over a period of time the vaccum would get so large that it would have to self consume/self destruct itself to balance out the happy/healthy end.

16607,3tVoKZ5pHMU,Hi bro ! I am entering in same engineering college and branch of Yours!!!,
16608,3tVoKZ5pHMU,Your video is so good!,
16609,3tVoKZ5pHMU,"Today I came purposefully to revisit your first video. The way you guys have grown over the year is tremendous. All the best guys, waiting to learn much more from you!",

16617,3tVoKZ5pHMU,I truly agree to you as a engineering student,
16618,3tVoKZ5pHMU,Can&#39;t believe its your first video on channel<br>Its so damn good,
16619,3tVoKZ5pHMU,Not applicable to IIT&#39;s,
16620,3tVoKZ5pHMU,"Because of an inordinate and rigid emphasis on grades, our education system is training students to write and excel at exams. Education always looks to the past in order to preserve the past. It concerns itself with &quot;what was and what is&quot; as against &quot;what could be&quot;. Curiosity,  exploration and creativity ( hallmark of childhood) are systematically killed in schools. Analytical thinking , while necessary, isn&#39;t adequate to address problems in a world that&#39;s changing at unprecedented speed. Our pupils have become competent at breaking down a problem,  identifying chains of cause and effect and describing it. An overwhelming majority of them use word &quot;because&quot; excessively. That&#39;s all there is. No encouragement for asking &quot;why not&quot; as it smacks of rebellion and challenge to status quo. Pity that &quot;why not&quot; has the seeds of creative new ideas. &quot;Because&quot; is descriptive - it cannot lead to new ideas. &quot;Why not&quot; is generative - it leads to new creation. High time we introduced Design from standard 8, as it can train pupils to leave aside the obvious and work toward non-standard, unconventional solutions.",
16621,3tVoKZ5pHMU,Thanks!,

16647,3tVoKZ5pHMU,One thing I don&#39;t understand is if exam are taken to test your knowledge than when someone doesn&#39;t get good marks why doesn&#39;t the teacher teach the student the topic again. Why do they start with new syllabus,
16648,3tVoKZ5pHMU,One of the best lecture we missed in our engineering times !,
16649,3tVoKZ5pHMU,"There is one more important point<br>Which everyone ignores <br>Literally everyone<br>In school colleges importance is given to theory part not practical ,,<br>Reading this feels soo silly isn&#39;t it , oki let me give you an example,<br>Few years back we had computer subject in <a href=""http://b.com/"">b.com</a> and our lecturer taught us html which was basics of coding and no one knew that we were learning coding literally,, our fault was we didn&#39;t learn properly we didn&#39;t attend cls regularly but the mistake of our lecturer was there was not a single practical class with a computer , we wudve know wat we were learning, and the fun fact is our cls topper didn&#39;t even know that it was just a basics of coding, <br>Practical is more important than theory. <br>Practical is the best way to learn anything in a fastest way ,<br>If we can&#39;t apply a particular thing in our life to see how it works then only we should focus on theory....",

16662,3tVoKZ5pHMU,"Hi Ganesh,<br>I am a huge fan of yours for your deep insight of any topics,<br>👍👍👍<br>1. I have completed my engineering from Computer science background but you know what I really don&#39;t know about my subject.<br>2. I got a cgpa of 8 but  I  don&#39;t know how I get it. I just know that I got a degree that just BE passed.<br>3. In 3rd year 5th sem college placement training, again they are going with very small introduction of DB, C, Java, aptitude to get placement I have sit there to get placement in company. But you know what happens I didn&#39;t sit any placements not any single company. Why because I don&#39;t know what is engineering? That question I asked many times to myself. I have searched for books where I realised  that I am not qualified for engineering.<br>4. You know when I got to know about engineering subjects when I prepared for GATE, then I got real understanding how engineer thinks. <br>5. You are telling right every engineering college is became a business. There aim is to get as many as admission and to make lots of money but not making student to realise his full potential. What students wants to do in life.<br>Atlast your book recommendation is very good, I have covered some books specially &quot;Start with why&quot; .",

16701,I9p5K2Ke2MA,Buddy every company and competitor you mentioned use Microsoft&#39;s languages to build their products. Teams was simply better and more viable for the businesses and schools + the security issues with Zoom led to its image downfall. Don&#39;t agree with the content of this video.,

16704,I9p5K2Ke2MA,Come up with a case study on the Indian politics.  Why we can&#39;t even think of another party to form a central government even in the next two or three decades.,
16705,I9p5K2Ke2MA,MS teams is the engineering project. Most of the time doesn&#39;t work. Zoom is far better than MS teams which is more stable in all the platforms.,
16706,I9p5K2Ke2MA,"It&#39;s your understanding or limited perspective of the experience of Microsoft that what Microsoft does is Exterminate its competitors. In reality, Microsoft NEVER does this, and it does not need to do this.<br>Microsoft never capitalizes and invests and supports the products of the present or the future. What it does is use the past as a means to grow the future. What do I mean by this? Consider Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Azure(especially LUIS inside Azure) and Power BI.<br>All these products are not the requirement of the present (like what google does) and they are neither what will be wanted (NOT &quot;REQUIRED&quot;) in the future (like the way Meta invested heavily in AR and VR). What Microsoft does is it remodel the things which were required in the past and offer it in the present. By past, I mean replacing a document as words written on paper by Typewriter FROM and WITH Microsoft Office 365. This is how Microsoft creates and crafts it&#39;s market share. And this is also why companies like Google or Meta or Apple can never beat Microsoft.<br>The only reason why so many products that are being offered by Microsoft fail is because of the fact that the past will be liked by people in the present only when and which and by(NOT &#39;through&#39;) a form of an art, like music or work of an artist, or something else similar to being an artist.<br>Steve Jobs is channeling the art of the future into the present, whereas Bill Gates is transforming the past into the art of the past into the present. I wrote &#39;past&#39; twice with respect to Bill Gates because the past cannot be channeled straight away. First, that past has to be transformed. Then, after the transformation of that past into the present, this transformation of the past known as the present has to be turned into an (NOT &quot;THE&quot; ART)art.<br>This is why Bill Gates is so confused when he sees the present trends. He cannot make sense of the art of the past in present.<br>In order for Microsoft to be successful, it has to capture a fair share of the market through this logic. This logic will be applicable in each and every successful product of Microsoft.<br>I can simplify this logic. In order for Microsoft to create a successful product, it has to use the product or service successful in the past as a means to achieve bliss(PURE ENJOYMENT) in the present while discarding the thoughts of the future(the thoughts of the future need to be discarded because they are the obstacle in achieving bliss). Let&#39;s take an example of a wheel. Let&#39;s say Microsoft wants to use the concept of the past, the WHEEL into the present and use it to create wealth.<br>The wheel is a means to ease the transportation of objects from one place to another. Say, Microsoft wants to create a software helping people involved in the supply chain. Then, this software will eliminate all the obstacles that have occurred when something had to be transported. What would be the root of the obstacle in transporting something? It would be, transporting it and not teleporting it. To achieve bliss, you have to teleport it. This is why Microsoft creates a supply chain software where only those things would appear through which you would feel that the product is teleported. And you will find the same logic in one of the top 3 leading software which eases the supply chain.<br>And the entire thing in the para behind this statement is written by someone who knows love as well as who as psychopathic tendencies. Because he has made both the past and future collide with the present, while being a witness of the witness.",

So it has its advantages but let&#39;s see how it works in India. Hopefully, both can sustain - local specialized shops for quality products and 7-11 for convinience.",

They can&#39;t earn through ads, hence they charge more for their product (Security is a plus point to this).<br>Now they are limited to the Apple ecosystem, but a player like Google is working hard to be as efficient as possible in the software space and available to everyone. Disadvantage: Google uses your data for ads. If you see older I/Os, you will see how Sundar Pichai explains every rollout, what motivated them and what was the problem statement. Apple will survive only on hardware quality and few brand loyalists.",

Just like how digital camera killed Kodak or electric cars are going to kill a host of car manufacturers.<br>To Apple&#39;s credit it created the smart phone market, it created the concept of an eco-system, it killed the music labels business.

17079,C2tjnJOy7Hw,Loyalty aside apple is just not worth comman peoples money.  Sure u r rich or get paid absurdly or have to show status go for apple. But generally u get all those features at discounted price elsewhere aka android.  So a Dumb ass bloke can also get shit done without apple.,
17080,C2tjnJOy7Hw,One think you missed. In western countries we don’t buy phones outright but on a contract and many times it’s free just to stay in the contract for 1-2 years. So price point is not that of a barrier for apple users with the retail customer.<br><br>Wholesale buyers like the carrier make money via accessories &amp; plans.,

17083,C2tjnJOy7Hw,Can you make a case study about how government subsidies in southern India especially Andhra Pradesh have ruined the economy of the state and have turned the once a thriving state into ruins.

17121,bUFVJKwZYP4,Good information sharing 👍,
17122,bUFVJKwZYP4,Prime video and disney+ are nowhere in the league of producing quality content. Netflix is the best ott till now if someone prefers quality contents over money.,

17125,bUFVJKwZYP4,"I don&#39;t think your analysis is 100% true, Netflix is not that expensive, I can afford 179 rupees but I dont do it because Netflix has become a tool of propoganda for useless leftist movies, how many times has this happened that you are sitting with your friends thinking kya dekhe?

17130,bUFVJKwZYP4,This is a gem video. The subscription based model problem that you mentioned is a problem that netflix is facing. And this is why netflix shares tumbled. Awesome analysis.,
17131,bUFVJKwZYP4,Sony and Netflix should merge.,
17132,bUFVJKwZYP4,"One of the reasons why Netflix is losing it&#39;s subscribers is because of the phenomenon of &#39;wokeness&#39;. Netflix relies on new content and almost all of it&#39;s new content is made with a liberal agenda which irks its customers who do not want to be preached to. Disney and other giants are also doing something similar, but at least they have ownership of older material which was not pandering to only one section of society or have ownership of moneymaking franchises like Marvel which are breaking new grounds in storytelling. Viewers are spoiled for choices and in fact, do not mind streaming through multiple services so long as content is unique and entertaining. Netflix is missing both kinds of content.",
17133,bUFVJKwZYP4,Now it is true.,
17134,bUFVJKwZYP4,You deliver the content so clearly.,
17135,bUFVJKwZYP4,"Bro, now Netflix is thinking of ads, you saw this coming 😯👏",

17144,bUFVJKwZYP4,Another great content! I myself have been pondering over investing in Netflix and was wondering why the share s dropped so sharply.,
17145,bUFVJKwZYP4,Your content is more powerful than the OTTs we have in the market.,
17146,bUFVJKwZYP4,"What is the future of Netflix?  More of technology and partnership with focused content creators like animation companies,  movie content making agencies and so on. <br>From business angle, advertisements will bring some revenue.<br>Online stores and merchandising is old way of making few dollars. <br>Games and live streaming of sports will also help with sponsorships. <br>Web series is another way. <br>The question of beating Walt Disney, the original creator is difficult but niche placement will do. <br>Evolution is part of business and little change in revenue model and add-on products will keep Netflix alive.",
17147,bUFVJKwZYP4,"I love Netflix, they don&#39;t brag about their work or art. Their animation is too good.<br>They should keep focus on production because it&#39;s very vast when it comes to genres.<br>I have amazon prime and I actually never watch anything from it because its very trashy. <br>Netflix app has very premium feel to it.<br>While HBO as an Indian is not pleasant because its do western and I don&#39;t feel much relatable content in it. Their DC series are awful and embarrassing Hollywoodish lol",

17150,bUFVJKwZYP4,"Yes it will fail, miserably. 😛",
17151,bUFVJKwZYP4,Only way out for Netflix is to either price the plans. The basic plan should atleast have FHD. They can try following loss leader system by partnering with telecom and dth services and offer at a discount. This will give them the subscribers they need.,
17152,bUFVJKwZYP4,Downfall for Netflix <br>1. Netflix subscription is expensive compared to other streaming platform. <br>2. Netflix original content especially for indian audience is not that good <br>3. Many good tv shows are leaving Netflix such as Daredevil.,
17153,bUFVJKwZYP4,Real reason is wokisim of Netflix which help Netflix to fail,

17198,bUFVJKwZYP4,Hi <br>I have only recently started watching your content and I must say that it&#39;s very crisp and indepth at the same time. <br>In this video about Netflix you need to have mentioned the fact in the fight between Netfix and Prime there another angle.  Netflix is a customer  to Amazon ! Why ? Because Netflix uses AWS (Amazon Web services) to store and retrieve it&#39;s content. So Netflix is at a disadvantage to that extent.  <br><br>Keep it up dude. You are doing a great job.,

17203,ERN8MZl-2pw,I found the cost comparison between petrol and electricity not upto mark. <br>What is forgotten is that as the number of EVs will increase and it will also increase demand of electricity usage.

17228,ERN8MZl-2pw,By your logic of electricity vs oil comparison the Government of India should only use Electric Vehicle for its MPs MLAs and Bureaucrats. This will motivate the common man to purchase an EV,

17243,ERN8MZl-2pw,"Cost of electricity will go up and cost of fuel is going to come down. EV&#39;s are the biggest joke of 21st century. Remember ,electricity is generated from  burning same hydrocarbons. Moreover batteries are more hazardous for our environment as it degrades the soil quality which is the only place we grow our crops and food. There is always going to be air pollution some way or the other but we need to preserve our soil as there isn&#39;t any alternative for it !. The whole EV saga has been started by US by spreading fake narratives about how good EV&#39;s will be for the environment which is quite the opposite. In reality ,the main reason why this narrative is being pushed through media is because US is running out of oil and countries like Russia have abundance of oil &amp; gas , therefore, in order to stay relevant they had to come up with some brainwashing , hence the EV !",

17270,ERN8MZl-2pw,I find most valuable knowledge for my business development. Great video,
17271,ERN8MZl-2pw,"Govt. of India earns 3.5 lakh crore in excise duty on Petrol annually. A good portion of that money is used for subsidies to attract more votes and eventually win elections. Petrol is a cash cow for any Govt. in India and it is foolish to think that any govt will think about their country first and then about their ‘chair’. Its a universal truth. This high custom duty on EVs and the fact that EV is still not in the green energy list of the govt. is a clear indication tht our govt. will try, as much as it can, to discourage EVs. But they know sooner or later the international community will put pressure on our govt. to reduce custom duty and promote EVs. So they are trying to mint as much money they can and hence there is a stupendous increase in excise duty on petrol. Before investing anywhere in this sector, its better to wait and watch for we don’t know how long the govt can delay EVs.",
17272,ERN8MZl-2pw,"Some says Hydrogen Vehicles will replace EV, it may be true.",
17273,ERN8MZl-2pw,"Hai Everybody,      can be heard even when video is on mute, correct me if I am wrong 🙄",
17274,ERN8MZl-2pw,Do we have the capability to serve the demand of these electric vehicles in future? Most of the villages in India still have to face load shading issues(power cuts).,

17276,ERN8MZl-2pw,You are a genius,

17279,ERN8MZl-2pw,I think you forget the fact that EV still require energy in the electricity form. India generates electricity from coal and other fossil fuels such as gas . EV’s don’t solve either of these problem. Also lithium is not abundantly available resource and the pollution impacts post 10 years usage of cars aren’t considered .,

17286,ERN8MZl-2pw,Great great 🤩,
17287,ERN8MZl-2pw,But what if the cost of electricity shoots up as the demand increases? Do we have the infrastructure to generate so much electricity in a green way?,
17288,ERN8MZl-2pw,Indians don&#39;t use electric car,
17289,ERN8MZl-2pw,"Floored by your analysis, just in the first video I watched. Subscribed.",
17290,ERN8MZl-2pw,"As you compared the nexon to nexon EV......top model of nexon petrol is around 13.L compared to 17 L for nexon ev , which means consumer is already paying  4 L EXTRA  which comes around Rs 4/km extra to this 0.97 Rs",
17291,ERN8MZl-2pw,"In my opinion why ppl are hesitant for EV are the Electricity cost.....whatever you have mentioned is just the base cost for 1 unit of electricity that too I assume is without the other fixed cost that are charged by the Discoms. Also the fixed charges are based on slabs which means  more the electricity consumed more will be the per unit cost also the fixed cost will increase thereby increase tje overall per unit cost. Plus once EV becomes a mainstream the demand for electricity will also increase thereby again raising the cost + this will pave the road for Discoms to exploit the customers, I&#39;ve myself experienced during lockdown the threatening nature of discoms",
17292,ERN8MZl-2pw,But electricity prices will increase as we are setting in US,
17293,ERN8MZl-2pw,Ur a gem bro,
17294,ERN8MZl-2pw,Totally agree on milenge point but bro don&#39;t you think as more and more evs come in to the market the demand for electricity will also rise which might increase the cost of electricity per unit too. <br>Don&#39;t you think it will be disagreebale to compare milage cost by current situation .<br>Bro i totally understand your point <br>just wanted to know your views on it ....,

But in India, it is noticed that people tend to use their car for at least 3 years to 5 years (also some people use it for more than 10 years).

17485,8mef_bxijJk,Division of labour is a fantastic idea which suceeded in the manufacturing industry.

17523,EUcVBDtJo5M,They might even have a different business model. My Android phone showed cred using battery intensively (like 20-30% of total usage) running in background. This went on for a couple of weeks until I uninstalled the app. Lo and behold my phone was back to good battery backup. I don&#39;t what sorcery cred was doing in background with using as much battery! And I have CRED installed on my iPhones and have never seen this issue,

17564,EUcVBDtJo5M,I get it! This video is sponsored by CRED. I need to make a whole video to explain the psychological manipulation this video is trying to do to the viewers. Comparing JIO &amp; Google maps to CRED is the joke of the century.  CRED is a bigger fraud than Byjus.,

17570,EUcVBDtJo5M,people will literally stop using CRED when it will stop giving us cashbacks,
17571,EUcVBDtJo5M,"Having seen few of your videos, I come to the conclusion that most views are biased on how you view things based on perception than actual statistics as you have omitted in many. Todays, Creds revenue comparison with that of Jio, is a tactful manipulation to infuse a hypothetical idea. In comparison of Amazons warehouse and Reliance small stores, you never identified the costing related to both, but simply stuck to the idea of delivering the packet on a scooter. What in case of a sofa set return? As in the Ambani case, everyone knows Friends of Reliance, but what made him a dark house is how he routed the funds and also made a <br>killing !",

Here are the few things which I beg to differ that you compare Jio with Cred,  Customer acquisition - Jio all together come up with a new product that is 4G LTE which doesn&#39;t support 3G smart phone that&#39;s why they roll out for free to navigate customer from 3G to 4G smart phone where 1GB data was costing around 300 rupees, Business hold - Jio had invested heavily which was around 1.5 lakh crores and to get break even for that they are supposed to have a certain number of customer to maintain the price point and with the investment of 1.5 lakh crores of rupees, they have created entry barrier for the other new players in same business also the initial investment was so high the existing player can&#39;t change their strategy as they were already heavily invested in 3G infrastructure which doesn&#39;t hold true with players like Cred where any new player can enter at any point of time and again they will start cash burn which lead to shift of customer as it is a digital product. So here is the big question about the sustainability of the business.",
17579,EUcVBDtJo5M,Freecharge ke business model pe video banao. Itana cashback kese deta hai recharge pe 😲,
17580,EUcVBDtJo5M,Really awesome content Bro...as always,
17581,EUcVBDtJo5M,I think why he is not focusing on profit and incuring loss is he is just  into growth of the company coz even if they make profit 25%will go to govt. as corporate tax. He only takes 3L per annum from his company. He must have an exit plan may be.,
17582,EUcVBDtJo5M,"This video sponsored by CRED, just kidding 😅.. Good video 👌",
17583,EUcVBDtJo5M,Totally loving this channel…. Is there any other channel like this which will be a help for mba students,
17584,EUcVBDtJo5M,"Ganesh, I must say that you too have followed the success mantra of &quot;Cred&quot; and have successfully executed phase-1; Get the users on-board with Quality Videos. <br>Looking forward to your Phase -2 😅",
17585,EUcVBDtJo5M,big companies cannot become banks in india .  correct me if im wrong.,
17586,EUcVBDtJo5M,There are lot of rich people who dont use credit cards<br>Business are most iggnored one credit card campani issuing. <br>cred is target for job holder only mostly IT sector,
17587,EUcVBDtJo5M,Thanks for the vid. Have not used Cred yet though. Will need more transparency. The only revolution is cutting the red tape and implementing systems not surprised by the rest.,
17588,EUcVBDtJo5M,I am a big fan of your spoken English,
17589,EUcVBDtJo5M,"Try permanently deleting your Cred account. It is not easy.<br><br>I stopped using Cred because: <br>- I have auto debit enabled for credit card payment from savings account. So Cred it not required at first place.<br>- It asks for full email account permission to read the statements automatically. No option to upload the statement manually or forward the statement to some email address. So I was not using this feature.<br>- Used to get ₹20 to ₹30 cashback per billing cycle for paying through Cred which did not seem like a big incentive for sharing my financial details. Cred needs to have access to my SMS in order to automatically fetch the bill amount, which is again a concern.<br><br>Overall, Cred doesn&#39;t honor privacy as much as one would have like. And one app which I can live without.<br><br>I like your videos. But this one was a bit misleading. People can live without Cred and they are better off staying away from it.",
17590,EUcVBDtJo5M,Case study on slice as well.,
17591,EUcVBDtJo5M,I think you have to help build startups and educate new businessmen of this generation.,
17592,EUcVBDtJo5M,"What is this guy smoking?? Pretty sure Kunal wasn&#39;t sitting there thinking of a problem to solve. He was rather looking at how to make money. Don&#39;t let all this jargon fool you, he is doing the same thing everyone is doing. That is, Taking peoples data and making money from it. They are not going to alter any damn behavior, people will still keep taking loans and get into debt. Ofcourse they will give cashbacks, if im making money off of your data i have to give you something to sleep better at night right? stop equating a one stop dashboard for credit card payments to google maps and other solutions which changed peoples life for the good. CRED is just a quick way for another one of these money minded preneurs to make money in the cracks rather than bringing real value and changing common Indians&#39; lives. What a great way to give a positive spin to this company, let the hype around Kunal Shah begin!",
17593,EUcVBDtJo5M,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUcVBDtJo5M&amp;t=5m13s"">5:13</a> - &quot;Which friend I am talking about&quot; and not &quot;which friend am I talking about&quot;<br>Great content tho! Willing to edit your scripts haha",
17594,EUcVBDtJo5M,Why shall I give my card details just for rewards,
17595,EUcVBDtJo5M,I also use maps but only for unknown places,

17597,EUcVBDtJo5M,CRED is basically the FOGG,
17598,EUcVBDtJo5M,Cred already started personal loans 🙃,

Very touching story.. sounds fairytale which was too good to be true... Respect to the business leaders of Southwest... <br>Amazing business Story as well ..

17612,ebxaYgw8Nfw,Superb 🔥🔥,
17613,ebxaYgw8Nfw,"Indian Airline industry leaders need to understand that Airline runs because of their employees hard work, they work in a highly regulated industry where they need to maintain their licences through regular Traing and checks no other industry has as many annual proficiency checks. Also being a service industry you are not privileged to have Saturday, Sunday and festival holidays, need to sacrifice on many social events. Unfortunately in India we have no worth mentioning labour laws and regulations to protect their pay and allowances of the employees, so it is very essential for top management to focus on ethical values to protect their subordinates before self, especially at times of business financial crises. Aviation Industry like all industry goes through the ups and downs but this industry being very cash intensive and dependent on multiple vendor support system, cash flow management needs follow a tight prescribed channel leaving no chance for diversion cash out of the system, diversion of funds from system is a recipe disaster. There is a need to consistently to find, evaluate and implement new strategies to reduce operational cost rather than taking easy step of pay cuts and retrenchment, for this the management has to have a minimum Business Management qualification, more so on aviation management, just in case a particular person needs to be positioned and promoted for management post at least ensure he goes through executive management course or send him on deputation to good airlines to learn integrities of management so that he or she becomes more contributing in his or her new role, why just depend on job learning. Manage Airline to make it profitable so you take care of your unassuming, hard working employees who in many cases are single bread earners of the family.",

17668,ebxaYgw8Nfw,While everyone here is praising SW and comparing it with TATA and all. You don&#39;t understand that the company only focused on profitable routes while ignoring others. Whereas AirIndia has to cover unprofitable paths as well which is why it is in losses. Values of both are different. Not sure what will happen when AI is privatised.,

17739,XZxQtzUi6d8,U know i laugh when ppl hold Singapore in Asia  or Rwanda in Africa as a model tiny population and tiny land is really not hard to manage and make efficient  without natural resources  because when u are stratigic location and minerals resources  or are large nation the powers at be  bother and shake u and disturb your development  iraq oil afghanistan minerals iran oil and gas africa everything from arable land 65% every known resource,
17740,XZxQtzUi6d8,why we are not taught about what japanese army did in schools? they only teach us nagasaki and hiroshima,
17741,XZxQtzUi6d8,The British left mainly because they had neither the finances nor the national will to post troops to far-flung colonies to keep them subjugated just after the end of the Second World War.,
17742,XZxQtzUi6d8,Singapore is such an incredible place. I am here now and completely in awe of its history and journey. Wow! &lt;3,

17746,XZxQtzUi6d8,Indians are very cunning and these people &amp; politicians leads corruption.,
17747,XZxQtzUi6d8,Bro all your video’s at least deserve a “like” minimum…,
17748,XZxQtzUi6d8,We should compare ourselves to Singapore and not Pakistan.,
17749,XZxQtzUi6d8,"What we learnt is pulling the legs of one who is doing good, and ass licking of the wealthy scoundrels.🤣",
17750,XZxQtzUi6d8,the only thing is they had a nationalistic leader just after independence and a small region to look after and we had someone like Nehru😒😒,
17751,XZxQtzUi6d8,"This channel is for facts, knowledge and the way he is explaining thats commendable hat&#39;s off",
17752,XZxQtzUi6d8,Can Andaman and Nicobar become next Singapore? Because of location advantage ?,
17753,XZxQtzUi6d8,Good information,
17754,XZxQtzUi6d8,I just cant get over the hypocrisy my some fellow indians every one shows support on this video but fact is no one will leave their place and if goverment took them they will hate it,
17755,XZxQtzUi6d8,"The Britishers, created misery wherever they went, abandoning countries in chaos and desperation. But from the hell we rise and shine brighter than thou.",
17756,XZxQtzUi6d8,"Great video, very clear and concise narratives. Good historical research, I can only image the time it took to make this video.",
17757,XZxQtzUi6d8,Where is part 2,
17758,XZxQtzUi6d8,One the other hand we have India with rich land but morally bankrupt inhabitants.,
17759,XZxQtzUi6d8,Amerika is a slum! Singapur is a high class!,
17760,XZxQtzUi6d8,Brains and hard work overtook size and stupidity.,

China had been fighting Japan for decades, weakening them. Don&#39;t let your prejudices from today make you forget the suffering and sacrifices of the last generation.",
17764,XZxQtzUi6d8,Lee kuan yew made Singapore. <br>Modi is doing the same job for India.,
17765,XZxQtzUi6d8,The japanese prime target was the chinese since they had their own ancient grudge. U ask any chinese &amp; u&#39;ll hear from them. The japanese were not either brutal nor they targeted other race.,

17767,XZxQtzUi6d8,Your more frequent uploads have made this my go to channel for news with a splash of entertainment at the start.. Keep it up!!! A lot has changed and that&#39;s on everything but the truth is I don&#39;t even care much about bullish or bearish market anymore because  Bryan Anderson got me covered as I am comfortably  making  13.1B T C monthly.....,
17768,XZxQtzUi6d8,Singapore 50 years ago may not have huge land or population or resources but they had the greatest asset and that is it had a Chinese ethnicity majority population at about 80% of the population. That transformed Singapore from a wretched dirt poor country to a major global financial centre and a highly developed country just like all other Chinese majority regions are developed. I think that explains a lot why Singapore is so developed.,
17769,XZxQtzUi6d8,Instead we had that asshole Nehru as our first PM who was nothing but a Indianized version of British,
17770,XZxQtzUi6d8,"Although I am an Indian and I studied in an Indian school, I have read about the greatness of Mr Lee Kuan Yew in my textbooks. He is and will always remain the greatest leader of Singapore",
17771,XZxQtzUi6d8,Too much respect for the Brits. Good content though.,
17772,XZxQtzUi6d8,there was no gorkhali at 1950 otherwise gurkhas would have cut them in pieces for sake of god and singapoor,
17773,XZxQtzUi6d8,"During just 2-3 days, I heard the horrific activities done by Japanese people during WW2 from 2 different sources. First story was of Andaman Nicobar &amp; now its about Singapore. I used to think &#39;Japanese were very nice people&#39;. But now a days, I&#39;m getting to know such things that I can firmly say  we should not see any story from one angle only. Every thing has 2 sides...",

So grew up in 90s and 2000s to poor class but my grandpa was staunch Gandhian. I grew up poor if not for the geneorosity of our peer (not government). I was the first in family to graduate collede (engineering) and first to travel abroad. My first country was Singapore and was mesmerised by its development. I was shocked how such a small country can be a beacon of growth for entire Asia. Then I learnt about Lee Kuan Yew. If not for this man, Singapore would have been still a poor country. This man achievement must be taught in school and in B-schools as he single handedly changed Singapore. I am saving money for my masters will do a thesis on Lee Kuan Yew even if I am my 50s.",

They will cry, “My Lord! Why have you raised me up blind, although I used to see?. Allah will respond, “It is so, just as Our revelations came to you and you neglected them, so Today you are neglected.

17903,nvN3cpi2Dgg,Well said,

I was buying Zara womenswear extensively as they were very affordable, I can afford more items and the bright colours of the outfits while most of the other fashion retailers were playing safe with blue, grey, black, white, beige etc. I personally believe it&#39;s Zara who changed that and Brough more confidence to women when they were dressed in bold and bright colours and make them stand out from the crowd. Though the quality of their items are medium I still have a handful of items that have lasted over 5 years and still in a great condition. I have changed my strategy now. I&#39;ve reduced the number of items I buy and being very selective as well. I now mix and match Zara items with better quality and pricier pieces of clothing so it doesn&#39;t look like from Zara.",

Because our teachers will hand out all these questions and worlkload tends to get a lot since a part of the portion of the syllabus is rushed during the last week before exams actually start .<br>There seems to be no benfit in just brainlessly copying questions and answers .

Kudos to the work you are doing my friend. My support is with you always.,
18647,cWsxSP3KGvs,"Major factor of education is individual interest,2nd our govt., Gave right to education both in dpsp and fundamental rights compulsory.,by this working children below 14years came nil,by years,3rd mid day meal scheme in Tamil Nadu privogued students atleast to assemble and take attendence this happened in 80s , when it&#39;s comes to macaulay committee he himself visulized Indian education alreeady advanced In all subjects from maths to celestial science,his beggar queen ordered to destroy all evidences of  our proof and looted to west and boasting like pigs .,curzon,clive,wellesley,Hastings,linlinthow,and some beggars because of above,India got extendted to 250yrs, only good is we got whole land u ified ,but In 1947 this land seperated by pamila diverse thighs  ,cost is partion .<br><br>Long live my country",
18648,cWsxSP3KGvs,"I think there should no limit in the syllabus, there should be a minimum syllabus of which everyone should understand the basic of and there should be no limit.... No matter which ever standard you are in, u are allowed to know or understand anything u want and in which ever topic u want..... There should be no necessity to know all the subjects or topic without ur intrest and no limit in exploring the interested topics..<br>And moral values should be taught to build up a positive mindset..<br>If asked to teachers that why is education important, their reply is &quot;to become a proper human being&quot; but I don&#39;t understand how f=ma makes us a better human... <br>How to make proper decisions on hard times and good times, how to treat with people, how to improve our character and how to live happily should be taught....<br>Money, Job, career are a need to keep our family, partners and society happy so that we can live happily.<br>But now the society and the system has changed the minds, that people are ready to leave family, relationships and betterment of others to have a good job and career and money.",
18649,cWsxSP3KGvs,"The more I watch your videos, the more I become curious about the topic that you present. Thanks for such wonderful information.",
18650,cWsxSP3KGvs,"Just a year before this video, you had made a video about the wrongness of the education system. <br><br>Now I hope that everything becomes better.",
18651,cWsxSP3KGvs,Think School thanks for ur insight analysis on NEP. I am PhD and to prepare youth future ready I am not a college professor. I left college to join corporates and then started own employbility enabled training with the support of CSR of corporates to offer in almost no fee to youths. In my team 80% are interns from commerce n mgmt courses. I feel so fortunate to contribute in line of NEP.,
18652,cWsxSP3KGvs,I prefer your latest look than this one.,
18653,cWsxSP3KGvs,"Well said. Thank u giving me clear explanation of what I was thinking. <br><br>One thing I realize is different in North American education system is teaching kids from kindergarten about how to treat others, respect others even if you disagree, have dignity and self respect, keeping bubble space, self care and name it to tame it. <br><br>I strongly feel if we add such emotional intelligence and socio behavioural skills in our system, it would be beneficial to the country, less struggle when you go out of the country or welcoming or invite foreigners safely in Bharat. <br><br>Keeping my eyes on more educational related videos too.",
18654,cWsxSP3KGvs,👍🏻,
18655,cWsxSP3KGvs,Absolutely true. 🙏👍 nice presentation😍,
18656,cWsxSP3KGvs,What about different languages in India.,
18657,cWsxSP3KGvs,Yess yessss! Loved this videoo!!,
18658,cWsxSP3KGvs,I always thought about this When Will Change Our Sad Education System  I&#39;m truly happy with this decision &lt;3,
18659,cWsxSP3KGvs,excellent video,
18660,cWsxSP3KGvs,Nicely articulated.... breaking the status quo by bringing in changes.<br>High time this happens in our legal system to bring Order in the society and punishing the wrongdoers,
18661,cWsxSP3KGvs,Aap ka naam kya hai? <br>Sounds nice when you add Hindi snippets. Keep it up,
18662,cWsxSP3KGvs,That questing thing happen to me many times....every time I would ask something teacher start shouting,
18663,cWsxSP3KGvs,One more policy he included.....Let indian think that English is better than their language and they will lose their cultural and moral education.,
18664,cWsxSP3KGvs,"But most students don&#39;t know why they are studying English, Hindi, Maths, Science, and Social Science. Learning with zero application is an absolute waste of 17 or 18 years of schooling. It is the problem! Blaming the &quot;education system&quot; is just a silly excuse! No education system will ever be perfect. Let&#39;s get over it and do something practical or go extinct in a thousand years. The choice is clear, I suppose. 😆😆😆",
18665,cWsxSP3KGvs,Waiting for implementation....,
18666,cWsxSP3KGvs,♥️this video has so much value to it. <br>tq,
18667,cWsxSP3KGvs,We need to be optimistic and pessimistic at the same time to actually be able to come up with solutions to the problems in the education system and rectify mistakes. I disagree with you on choosing either optimism or pessimism. Both are required.,
18668,cWsxSP3KGvs,"I have done masters in mechanical engineering. The saddest part is that after MTech, my only 2 gateways were either to join a Research lab as an associate or to get into lecturing. The only way to upscale my career option later was to do a phd, yet have no industrial exposure. <br>You are right, a person who teaches engineering students himself/herself is unemployable.",
18669,cWsxSP3KGvs,These changes are required since so long. Good the current government is taking this and hope the transition happens fast.,
18670,cWsxSP3KGvs,I appreciate your analysis . As a teacher I consider myself good but the even the college education where I teach is designed by University which has no practical applications. So why blame the British . They taught us English which has made us relevant in many countries. Blame the government which sat ducks  on an education system with no direction or vision. The teacher has no say in matters here as to what must be taught and how. We must look at the positives not negatives. The real question is how long are we taking to design our curriculum to s relavant model and how. This applies a cross every aspect of our education. No teacher participation in curriculum formation and mo broad vision. It&#39;s time we realize science and arts are not wo tight compartments. Google was designed by the tech and an artist after all.,
18671,cWsxSP3KGvs,Education system<br><br>19th century    syllabus<br>20th century    Teachers<br>21th century     Students,
18672,cWsxSP3KGvs,Only children born with good IQ make  it to the mark &amp; become Sundar Pichais ..but majority don&#39;t because of Indian education policy based on Orthodox British education system which was meant to produce  only office clerks.  <br>So when will Indian education policy produce a million sundar Pichais ? <br><br>First thing the NEP should enforce is that no Home-work should be forced on children because of which children spend hours  just  to copy paste &amp;  somehow submit the homework &amp;  after school hours let&#39;s say  if there is  homework even for just  6 subjects then a student spends minimum 6  to 9 hours in just writing &amp; filling pages  of  book  without reading or understanding the subject matter &amp; this is the reason most students are not sucucesfull in the later part of their life . and then we say when will India have a Microsoft or a Tesla or a Google.  India does not have a Elon musk or a Bill gates etc because  Indian education encouragees Mug-up culture and are producing crores  &amp; crores of  non thinkers who may pass university  exams but miserably fail  in competative entrance exams.  Why? Because Indian education only suits or is meant for children born with good or high IQ but what about the rest.  ?<br><br>Moreover since the student spends  many hours in  just  filling pages without reading the subject as the student does not get time plus because the student spends all his or her after  school-hours  time in non productive homework so the student does not get time to play or engage in extra circular activities.<br> So as a nation what kind of youth are we producing . As a nation India is producing non-productive..non physically fit youth who cannot compete  &amp; such a non competative youth population  start  taking  short cuts and so compromise on merrit &amp; so India has become a nation of non meritorious population &amp;  how can such a indian society  of non-meritorious   citizens    create a positive &amp; secure future for India.   This vicious cycle which is the DNA of the current  Indian education system must be broken to produce not a few sundar Pichais or Satya nadellas  but India needs a million sundar pichais..&amp; satya nadellas &amp; Vishwanathan  anand  else India will be a slave nation dependent on other nations just  to survive but not to prosper.,
18673,cWsxSP3KGvs,I like this NEP..&amp;good explanation buddy,
18674,cWsxSP3KGvs,Keep up good work.,
18675,cWsxSP3KGvs,Being a researcher and a Teacher are 2 different domains. Teaching is talent so  researching.,
18676,cWsxSP3KGvs,ur fluency 🤗🤗,
18677,cWsxSP3KGvs,"this is my scepticism towards the new education policy. the target of this policy on gross enrollment ratio in higher education is 50% whereas the present national average is 25<br>the highest score in this category is Tamil Nadu in the largest States which is already more than aspirational target of this policy. But the present new education policy is  contradictory to the goal of gross enrollment ratio in many ways. to improve the gross enrollment affordability and accessibility to the education is must which is curtailed by this policy and badly affect the poor people. of course to improve the nation  this kind of policy is essential but it should not marginalise the rights of poor people, so it should not be applied universally. the centre and states which has poor gross enrollment ratio would look deeper into the Tamil Nadu model to get benefited.",
18678,cWsxSP3KGvs,"I have binge watched your all the videos this video I love the most n yes optimism is the key of everything such as confidence,success n happiness.",
18679,cWsxSP3KGvs,I think execution is sluggish in Bharat...<br>Which needs to be taken care of first!<br>Nice share Ganesh 🙌🏼,
18680,cWsxSP3KGvs,Indian education system prepares students for jobs of the past and not the future.,
18681,cWsxSP3KGvs,It&#39;s been 2years when will it work ...,
18682,cWsxSP3KGvs,Seeing this after a year and still feel positive about everything you said about India.,
18683,cWsxSP3KGvs,Talk  education policy after 1 year where we reachef,
18684,cWsxSP3KGvs,i like the changes in Education,
18685,cWsxSP3KGvs,I was jealous when this was announced. Took time to feel good that the future will be bright . Awaiting for its implementation.,
18686,cWsxSP3KGvs,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWsxSP3KGvs&amp;t=05m46s"">05:46</a> That&#39;s the biggest 🤣",
18687,cWsxSP3KGvs,"BRITISHERS CREATED MASS GENOSIDES THROUGHOUT BHARAT !!LOOTED 45,000TRILLION POUNDS<br>Stop English imperialism",
18688,cWsxSP3KGvs,"The problem here is that only the students have curiosity, but the teachers they&#39;re supposed to be taught by, aren&#39;t. This then leads to a fixed old poor mindset of the teacher, and then most teachers believe that they&#39;re above all the students of the class and close their minds to anything new. <br>As the time would pass even if the curriculum would be updated, still the students would have a pulling back effect from the teachers. The teachers have to be very curious and open to learning new things every day!",
18689,cWsxSP3KGvs,"Very good efforts taken by you is remarkable and I feel your hearty approach to make this new Education Policy be popular for betterment of students in India which they become the brave citizens of our country, Thanks",
18690,cWsxSP3KGvs,Such an in-depth investigation. Nation first policy will always benefit the subjects of the country 🎉 Gratitude,
18691,cWsxSP3KGvs,Can you give a detailed presentation of the New Education Policy. Thank you,
18692,cWsxSP3KGvs,Yes,
18693,cWsxSP3KGvs,Wonderful video,
18694,cWsxSP3KGvs,What is the definition  of education .,
18695,cWsxSP3KGvs,This was a very well put together research. I would have loved it if it talked about how reservation / quota going to work in relation to the new education policy.,
18696,cWsxSP3KGvs,India needs education revolution.  Just end exam oriented approach and other things will fall in place. New education policy really looks game changer. excited,
18697,cWsxSP3KGvs,"A totally wrong analysis. Absolutely rubbish. This video is just a summary of various WhatsApp messages.<br>For example, the opinion that schools are designed to function like factories to find manpower for the factories is fundamentally incorrect. Obviously this channel has NO f**king insight into the fundamentals of pedagogy.<br>Indians have this thing where they blame all the evils of their education system on Macaulay. Can there be a more narcissistic behaviour??!!<br>Now, coming to the NEP, it is an eyewash. There are NO revolutionary or even distinguishing features of the new NEP. Let me elaborate...<br>First, the date of compliance for complete implementation of the NEP is 2040. Get that??!! 20 years. A policy that will be fully implemented only after 20 years, is a failure in whatever it plans to achieve.<br>&quot;PhD professors cannot teach&quot; is the gem regurgitated by the speaker. This sensational claim is NOT from any formal study. It&#39;s just his impression. And it&#39;s wrong on so many levels.<br>The NEP has focused on making &quot;coding&quot; an essential subject from grade 9 onwards. Coding was relevant in 2000-2010. That&#39;s when all the major companies of today came into existence. It&#39;s foolhardy to even assume that the same environment will exist in 2040 and that coding is relevant for the future world. The most stupid decision ever taken in education policy.<br>Also, there is NO attempt in the NEP to reduce the burden on today&#39;s students, make educational institutions more accountable, give more power to the students and their parents or to prepare the students for a world of 20 years from today.<br>There is no revamp of the curriculum except stupid exclusions of Muslim rulers from some texts.<br>There is NO integration of either the industry or the society with the education system, which BTW existed in the traditional gurukul systems.<br>In all, the NEP is the biggest eyewash lemon sold to the Indian populous in the form of redeeming set of changes. There is nothing of substance and shows the inability of Indians to properly upgrade their future generations.<br>To the people running this channel, I am starting to get the impression that your a mouthpiece for the ruling government. In any case, your biased, uninformed take on this and several other issues is doing a great disservice to the nation.<br>I know that you have to earn a living and have to have a job. But doing so by sacrificing future generations is NOT the way to go. If you do these things because you honestly believe in them, then your beyond redemption.<br>All I can say is, please do proper research before churning out filth like this on your channel. If India is to survive, then we HAVE to recognise &amp; accept our shortcomings and take action accordingly.<br>And we don&#39;t have a lot of time. The next 10 years make or break this country.<br>The first step to solve any problem is to admit that there is one.",
18698,cWsxSP3KGvs,So true about teachers..Specially the Phd once...Literally they know nothing about teaching ...,
18699,cWsxSP3KGvs,Well said. Our education lacks creativity and inspiration to think on one&#39;s own.,

18784,k--beE42aDs,I realized after listening to this video plus after reading short story on why ...u have applied same theory why we should read book which motivated me to read until 28 year no teach or mentor convinced me,
18785,k--beE42aDs,"It&#39;s a very helpful video for the begginers who has just starting Reading books or going to start! Thank you for all your Informative videos, keep guiding us like this",
18786,k--beE42aDs,"I salute you for your effort of detailed information about reading books. Recently I read the book Atomic Habbit , what I liked the most is after the end of  each chapter the author gives summary of that particular chapter which is so good. Later when ever we wish to read the book again, reading the summary is sufficient. It&#39;s a wonderful read.",
18787,k--beE42aDs,"such a gold mine of a video , great work man. keep it up!!!",
18788,k--beE42aDs,"Well First I would thanks @Abhiandniyu <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23abhiandniyu"">#abhiandniyu</a>  for the reel suggesting this channel and really am amazed by the quality of content here ❤️❤️❤️",
18789,k--beE42aDs,Thank you sir 🙏❤😃,
18790,k--beE42aDs,I have question ebooks or physical books ? I have studied with a physical book my entire school life it just feels immoral to use ebooks now. I cannot write in them or flip pages or anything but it&#39;s has major advantages as well like they are almost free easy to find and store . I don&#39;t know what to do,
18791,k--beE42aDs,It would be good that you could put all the steps in one slide at the end of the video. <br>Otherwise great work. It&#39;s like why and how you should read the books. Amazing :),

I had to uninstall the app in 2 days. it doesn&#39;t show good recommended songs, ques doesn&#39;t work well. its just not a good experience on YT Music. Spotify is much much better than YT Music. Gonna try Apple music soon, as it costs less than spotify. let&#39;s see.",
18804,HFzSK32G4OU,YouTube app is shit and not user friendly. Apple Music is so much easier. F Spotify. They don’t give shit to creators,

18806,HFzSK32G4OU,The very much awaited and very much needed channel for Business students and that too with such an analytical insights. Congratulations and thanks,
18807,HFzSK32G4OU,Thumbnail 🙄🤤🤯🤭,
18808,HFzSK32G4OU,Apple music is available on Android as well. You made it sound like its not :),
18809,HFzSK32G4OU,"Apple Music is also available for Android, and offers Hi-Res audio",
18810,HFzSK32G4OU,WHICH MIC HAVE U USED IN THIS VIDEO?,
18811,HFzSK32G4OU,Nice thumbnail,
18812,HFzSK32G4OU,"Usually, I like your content but this one has a lot of conjecture. <br>YouTube &amp; YouTube Music are two different apps altogether. YouTube may help you to redirect from a video to its audio platform but that music app still takes up a very very small portion of the market share as compared to Spotify.<br>It wouldn&#39;t matter therefore even if podcasts come under the same umbrella since it is immensely difficult to move a user loyalty from one music app to another unless there is a drastic difference in the offerings.<br><br>They might just end up coexisting.",
18813,HFzSK32G4OU,Boss Where is all this data from ? Shouldn&#39;t you give References ??,
18814,HFzSK32G4OU,"Thanks to napster <br>Art became cheap which caused  <br>Art to lose value <br>Arts not supposed to be cheap <br>Now thanks to napster we went from the Beatles, led zep, Nirvana, Kishore Kumar to <br>Nicki Minaj and ........",
18815,HFzSK32G4OU,I prefer Spotify over other music streaming platforms.,
18816,HFzSK32G4OU,"It was not ipod. It was revolutionary iTunes that steve jobs created to tackle piracy,",
18817,HFzSK32G4OU,And then there is me... who uses Wynk Music since it is free for airtel users😂,
18818,HFzSK32G4OU,Perhaps the most informative channel I&#39;ve ever watched!?,
18819,HFzSK32G4OU,All of the above apps are available on both iOS and android platform BTW!,
18820,HFzSK32G4OU,"Idk i still will prefer Spotify. I don&#39;t want to have only one app for podcasts, videos , music videos and music streaming. And Spotify is the undisputed king when it comes to music for me.",
18821,HFzSK32G4OU,Such a Wonderful video. Amazing content. Hats off to you brother !,
18822,HFzSK32G4OU,And there are guys who uses spotify mod version without paying for premium😂.but still ibdont use it and has founded many tricks to dodge from ads without having premium version,
18823,HFzSK32G4OU,"But you know what guys <br>  Drink a shot of vodka each time he utters those words<br><br>And you know what guys ,<br>  Then these videos will be even more fun",
18824,HFzSK32G4OU,"Most service which are other companies bread and butter, Amazon gives it as a addon service.... For 999rs, we get music, video and on top of that prime perks when we visit marketplace.",
18825,HFzSK32G4OU,Spotify CEO will be breaking his head after seeing this video 😂😂,

18828,HFzSK32G4OU,"Yeah Sure, <br>U gonna get a little more Views for that Thumbnail. <br>😄",
18829,HFzSK32G4OU,Can you please change the thumbnail😅 thumbnail is creating a mess in my brain.,
18830,HFzSK32G4OU,Good case study. Apple music is available for Android also. Nothing is free with Apple.,
18831,HFzSK32G4OU,"YouTube Premium is way better, we gets YouTube ad-free, background play and picture-in-picture playing along with YT music premium. Both at the cost of one Spotify subscription. Also suggestions and recommendations for music on YT music is as same as Spotify.",
18832,HFzSK32G4OU,RIP Google music,
18833,HFzSK32G4OU,"I&#39;m a DJ i have used almost all music streaming platform, music apps, music softwares etc.<br>Spotify is best platform. It pays less agree but other platforms too pay less. <br>That&#39;s why music streaming is not a guaranteed income source for Musicians.",
18834,HFzSK32G4OU,Youtube has some exclusive collection of music available nowhere else. I have the premium subscription of Youtube and I watch most of this channel&#39;s videos as a podcast by switching off the screen.,
18835,HFzSK32G4OU,That&#39;s why they collabed with Netflix to make the Shows and Movies Albums Spotify exclusive!<br>Just like Apple is doing with Apple TV+ contents on Apple Music,
18836,HFzSK32G4OU,"Apple Music for Apple users only? Dude do you even do your research? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFzSK32G4OU&amp;t=8m08s"">8:08</a>",
18837,HFzSK32G4OU,Spotify didn&#39;t have even half of my English song playlist let alone Hindi ones,
18838,HFzSK32G4OU,i use  resso,
18839,HFzSK32G4OU,Wht about wynk music u didn’t cover about that. Where it stays in the market,
18840,HFzSK32G4OU,why don&#39;t you talk in hindi?,
18841,HFzSK32G4OU,I would prefer Spotify over Youtube Music because of the quality of ads. Sometimes there are 10 min long ads. There is not background playing ability. It just feels so bad.,
18842,HFzSK32G4OU,"Thanks to YT&#39;s algorithm, Think School&#39;s videos keep popping up in my suggestions and boy, am I so eager to lap them up! Love your videos as always boss! 👌🏼👌🏼",
18843,HFzSK32G4OU,Actually Steve Jobs saved the music industry with iTunes! <br>iPods revolutionized music device&#39;s by being handy device with good amount of storage!,
18844,HFzSK32G4OU,YouTube music is kinda meh! It needs to a total overhaul.,
18845,HFzSK32G4OU,Where&#39;s Amazon music,
18846,HFzSK32G4OU,"I disagree that Yt music will come out a winner. I am a premium member of YouTube. The music quality and app experience are abysmal. <br>All the audiophiles prefer Spotify -&gt; Apple Music -&gt; Yt Music.  Apple music shines in ecosys, especially with AirpodsPro.<br>All the YT premium subscribers take the subscription for ad-free video experience, not for the music experience.<br>And Google has a history of killing off its apps.",
18847,HFzSK32G4OU,Thumbnail op🤣,
18848,HFzSK32G4OU,Anyone remember BeeMp3 ? Haha,
18849,HFzSK32G4OU,I think some important information about is missing,
18850,HFzSK32G4OU,ngl thumbnail caught me,
18851,HFzSK32G4OU,Good video. I think it would have been nice to mention how many billion dollars Apple made in iPods,
18852,HFzSK32G4OU,Whole Spotify-Joe Rogan fiasco and Apple Music engaging in a bit of trolling would make for a great part 2 in coming months we just don&#39;t know whats gonna happen currently maybe if some big artist pulls their music it&#39;ll be very interesting nonetheless.,
18853,HFzSK32G4OU,Great,
18854,HFzSK32G4OU,"The comparison between Apple music and other music apps is wrong and illogical. Apple music is strictly only for Apple users and rest all apps are for every user. <br>By a far margin, Apple music is the best music app in the world currently in terms of audio output and quality! Apple music is cheaper than Spotify and many other apps but provides best quality audio among all other apps.",
18855,HFzSK32G4OU,"There&#39;s a big issue you did not even touch, and that is yes Napster did change consumer behaviour but the wide scale change was with YouTube. People who wanted to listen to music now actually went on YouTube to listen to the most popular songs. YouTube is still the biggest platform for listening to Music.",

18872,HFzSK32G4OU,The thumb nail is funny though. It looks like Taylor Swift is farting into the mic 🤣🤣🤣,
18873,HFzSK32G4OU,"Before ipod came, there were all sorts of mp3 players. Steve Jobs made an apple mp3 player and called it ipod.",
18874,HFzSK32G4OU,@Ganesh.. really getting addicted to your video. I think your youtube channel is sweet spot too Education through real life case studies + connectivity. This is definitely like guiding guiding star to all those who want to move ahead in business but in right direction.<br>You r not just inspiring greatness but showing right direction as well.. <br>Lots of respect and love from Singapore.. from a Punekar..,
18875,HFzSK32G4OU,Microsoft doesn&#39;t have a music streaming service yet. On a very toughest day of Spotify they will purchase it for billion of dollers and destroy it completely within next 2-4 years. Quote my prediction 😎😜,
18876,HFzSK32G4OU,Why nobody is talking about VEVO which is very big and have big stars under it (almost all the top singers),

18883,HFzSK32G4OU,I love wynk music (Airtel),
18884,HFzSK32G4OU,Why is Taylor Swift on every thumbnail of similar topics,
18885,HFzSK32G4OU,Think school knows very well what to put on thumbnail👀,
18886,HFzSK32G4OU,I am a YouTube premium user but I ll never back out from Spotify premium. <br>I was an Apple music subscriber since its launch I gave it up bcs Spotify&#39;s recommendations are way better than Apple and YT. Btw just like everyone I have prime but never use it.,
18887,HFzSK32G4OU,Apple Music is on Android too. Just wanted to point that out.,

18890,HFzSK32G4OU,Spotify app is much better then YT music.. music streaming is smooth (it doesnt buffer) and the app is user-friendly..<br><br>YT music interface have lot of bugs specially when ur music get paused due to call intruption and also the playlist of YT music is very weak.<br><br>overall even spotify support is far better then yt music..,
18891,HFzSK32G4OU,you got one thing wrong. apple music can be used without having to buy any apple product. shows poor research from your side.,
18892,HFzSK32G4OU,Only here because of Taylor Swift 🤞❤,

18894,HFzSK32G4OU,Poster are good,
18895,HFzSK32G4OU,Apple never killed iTunes Store. You can still purchase music via iTunes.,
18896,HFzSK32G4OU,Something very important you missed out is the audio quality and audio bandwidth that these streaming services provide. <br><br>Spotify rocks in bandwidth and quality of the songs. <br><br>YouTube music is the worst amongst all.,
18897,HFzSK32G4OU,"Keeping thumbnail in mind, I need to admit that Taylor Swift is a killer cute and hot combination.",

19025,AzJKWgCCPh0,"Why are you saying Akbar is one of the greatest warriors of India along with Maharana Pratap? From this story, we can only conclude that Akbar was a decent/good man but how does it make him a great warrior? Any good man could have been Akbar.",

Keep up the good work guys 🙌🙌🔥🔥",
19039,AzJKWgCCPh0,Bro seriously....Akbar one the greatest warrior 😒... c&#39;mon that 5 ft glorified thief never had the courage to face maharana pratap. I respect your hard work in making these videos but facts are what really need to be told.,

19049,AzJKWgCCPh0,Boy.....<br>U forgot to mention a very important fact that the 5 feet ugly creature called jaahiluddin never came face to face with 7+feet Mahaaraanaa prataap even once. If he&#39;d come to fight brave maharana pratap then maharana would have done him in a few seconds.......<br>Good that u mentioned bravery of maharana but u forgot or missed to mentioned the cowardice of a 5 feet ugly looking jaahil akbar.......<br>Sorry state.....<br>And even sorry state that u mentioned weight of maharana as 110kgs......<br>How can a 7+ feet brave warrior have only 110 kgs as his weight......<br>Maharanas spear weighed about 80 kilos....<br>And 2 swords of around 20+ kgs each......,
19050,AzJKWgCCPh0,How the Khangress and the Commies have distorted Indian history! These antinationals systematically denegrated Hindu rulers. It is time our children studied the factual history of Bharat.,

I&#39;m shocked with people saying that textbooks don&#39;t talk about Shivaji Maharaj,  Maharana Pratap and  Subash ji. Maybe it&#39;s the cbsc or icse boards I&#39;m not sure can anyone confirm",
19064,AzJKWgCCPh0,♥🙏♥,
19065,AzJKWgCCPh0,But can Akbar really be called warrior though? he never fought on battleground I know he was emperor and all but why warrior and he just extended the existing Mughal Empire means he already had a huge army at his disposal since the day he became emperor,
19066,AzJKWgCCPh0,🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏,
19067,AzJKWgCCPh0,May I please know the source as to where you got to know that Maharana Pratap Singh did go in a hideout and procure more forces and ruled Mewar for another 20 years after eh Battle of Dewair. Thank you 🙂,

19083,AzJKWgCCPh0,"If one is responsible for massacres &amp; killings, uprooting other&#39;s cultures, conversions then any king or ruler is not great, hence there is no greatness about Akbar. He was a wise king, but greatness wouldn&#39;t suit a killer of his kind and many others. Pity on Indian Kings who joined Mughals, lack of pride and respect towards their own nation.",
19084,AzJKWgCCPh0,"I don&#39;t think it is erased, it was not mentioned",

19087,AzJKWgCCPh0,&quot;But you know what?&quot; the narrations that follow after this line by prasad is always mesmerizing. TBH I did not know about chetak&#39;s story even though i knew he was maharana pratap&#39;s horse. Every video from think school is so much loaded with information and inspiration.

19149,Wf6X-50OQdE,Thank you for sharing such valuable and untold information. Everyone as a freedom fighter gave their life. But we should not forget each and every hero  or restrict them just to two three lines in our textbooks. <br>Again humongous thank u for sharing such great content.,

19161,Wf6X-50OQdE,"was Netaji also responsible for the Brits leaving Sri lanka, Palestine Israel, and a major part of Northern Africa in period from 1947 to 1960. The US, portugese , france, all left the colonies because of netaji or it was all part of decolnization process. <br>He was no super man military leader who was to defeat to the British India army of the Allied offensive, the INA was moslty an irregular milita with little or no war expertise this was ww2 not some random skirmish.  <br>A regiment of women may sound inspiring but only a fool would use them in direct battle in 1940s.<br>Coming to naval mutiny andRed fort trials, the revolts primarily started because of bad reparations paid to the navy post the war for multitude of reasons. And the mass mobilization was done by guess who? the CPI and Congress (under Aruna Asif ali) the same lot who u are sublty trying to point is reponsible for &quot;hiding&quot; these facts. There is also a memorial in Colaba, Mumbai buiilt to honor this mutiny.<br>It was the Congress defence committe who defended the trio having Nehru and Aruna ali.  All this is well documented and taught at Universtiy level, school textbooks have to fit 150 yrs of history in less than 150 pages.<br>History as other subjects requires people to study at certain depth to understand its aspects, its far more complex than a mere heresay quote (of which there is absolutely no record) of Mr. Attlee",
19162,Wf6X-50OQdE,Jai Hind,
19163,Wf6X-50OQdE,INA was actually created by another freedom fighter Rasbehari Bose. Leter he make Netaji the Commender of INA.,

19174,Wf6X-50OQdE,"When I am a kid, I am not that into history lessons, but when ever I read abt satyagrah lead by Ghandhi, what impact would it make,  I mean to britishers. What will they loose. They said he united India. But many tried to and only he succeeded,  did British let him succeed? Because no ruthless idiot will give away their toys because we asked nicely. I mean they are ruthless, even my kid brain can deduce it, and they certainly not idiots. They manged to divide Indian ppl on bases of many things in just few decades, whereas we lived harmoniously for many centuries. Then came our 10th social teacher who used to get triggered when ever Ghamdhi topic comes. Some times he would burst and scold him straight every saying he is the reason the independence was delayed.<br><br>Later when we learn all these studies, I mean how gullible we have to be or how smart Ghandhi and britishers had to be to fool an entire nation of thinking we got independence because of non violence movement lead by Ghandhi.🤐",
19175,Wf6X-50OQdE,"Bit disappointed, you just shied off calling a spade a spade. It is no brainer who mis-represented/concealed the facts. Would have been better if you had clearly stated that. But still, good to see you raised the INA members were denied formal recognition, whereas your peers count this step as a foundation of Indian Army&#39;s discipline.",

19182,Wf6X-50OQdE,"Netaji is a hero in my mind since along time. I tried reading the book , ‘India’s biggest cover up’ but could not finish it . I would like to watch an episode on why and how a lie about his death was spread out and what proved that he was alive till 1985.<br><br>I have read in the book that Gandhiji very well knew that he was alive and not dead , however he was declared dead because everyone in congress knew that his popularity would easily surpass that of Gandhiji .",
19183,Wf6X-50OQdE,So many of our great leaders are omitted from our books and monuments so as to make place one family.,

Also read various books about Japanese Emperor Hirohito and how he was on a mission to create Greater Asia comprising of &quot;Asian looking people&quot;. <br><br>Subhash Chandra Bose is one of my favorite freedom fighters. However Japanese Army was interested in capturing only North East India as it fit their plan of Greater Asia. Also Naga soldiers who fought the Japanese fondly recall how happy they were to defeat them who left a trail of destruction in Burma and Manipur. This is not surprising as Japanese soldiers were so  brainwashed by Hirohito that this was their trademark style wherever they conquered.<br>If Japanese had won instead, North East India wouldn&#39;t be part of India. And they were not interested in attacking British in mainland India like Bose ji wanted.",
19196,Wf6X-50OQdE,Netaji was a nationalist in its truest sense 🖤hats off!! Shat shat naman 🙏🏼🇮🇳,

19239,BxDmbGFABJw,it sounds same like d mart in India 🇮🇳,
19240,BxDmbGFABJw,I worked in Walmart for a while in Canada. Another important point is employee growth is unlimited. Most of the people here worked for over 30 years which is uncommon in North America. Some one who started as a sales floor associate retired as a store manager and even as a Zonal head.,
19241,BxDmbGFABJw,D-mart....i hate it!...why u ask?..cuz most of their own products are made in china and i hate it...,

19243,BxDmbGFABJw,"one of the reasons walmart succeed was its location selection. In not so highly populated areas in which it could dominate the location , creating an unattractive market for competing stores. Hence creating a barrier to entry.",

19252,BxDmbGFABJw,"Walmart has become the butt of jokes. Your third point of Walmart being a haven to work is like hearing the Clintons where in fact not a family of career criminals, it&#39;s quite jarring because all I hear is Walmart sucks and the people there are lazy, very flippant and unmotivated. Shopping at Walmart is still cheap but so does buying in Costco. In fact with Costco, I hear good things like real savings passed down to customers, enthusiastic and motivated work force and a better shopping experience overall that does not leave you feeling tedious.",
19253,BxDmbGFABJw,It is always good to listen to you and the way you narrate it sounds simple and good to listen (I know it is not simple or easy ) lot of hard work and  data collection goes in hats off,

I have seven close family Members also working for Walmart, and I can tell you that Walmart does reward their employees well if you work hard.

19323,nnwqtZiYMxQ,"I live Mumbai, but, when I came here, about 3 years ago, we started to buy Amul not knowing that the competition was selling far good quality milk at the same price. Previously, I resided in Akola, Maharashtra, where Aarey was selling the same quality milk at 1/2 the rate. So, Amul is just exhausting it&#39;s customers money, and making huge profits by making low quality products.",
19324,nnwqtZiYMxQ,"Amul might be doing good business, but the quality of milk has been continuously worsening. Like here, I live in Mumbai City (District) and the the milk I bought is Amul Taaza (toned). The MRP for the packet of 1/2 litres is 26  but the shopkeepers sell it at 27, some selling for 28 or even 29 rs. And the milk is so thin that it is easily comparable to water. Then, I started buying some alternatives and they offer far superior quality compared to Amul and that too at the same price. So, I request to Amul management team to mind the quality of their products, too.",
19325,nnwqtZiYMxQ,"Can you pls make a video in particular about billion litre idea of varghese kurien sir , Is that and operation flood are they same in meaning",

19331,nnwqtZiYMxQ,Identification of change in consumer behaviour at an early step with new deals with third party collaborators are really inspiring.,
19332,nnwqtZiYMxQ,"No doubt  your video is good... .but i m not going to learn any strategy  from these dairy industry ,bcoz i  see  everyday cows, calf died cause of hunger infront of these dairy outlet.those cows not landed from sky there are used by these industry ,and later on  they thrown away.  <br><br>They have  all strategy to earn profit but no solution of cows ,bull and calf  .just throw them when they stop producing milk😑",

19340,nnwqtZiYMxQ,Absolutely loved the content and your narrative style!  I was soo hooked I got goosebumps! So happy to have found your channel,
19341,nnwqtZiYMxQ,"Yes sir it&#39;s very helpful for our case study.., ty so much.., want the content like this more.., 💕",
19342,nnwqtZiYMxQ,Everything is good...but in lockdown my company which supplies loose and Freshly milked A2 milk increased its volume  hugely as people become more aware about processing industry and moved from packet milk to fresh milk. You may be right on other facts but health benefits on packet milk that&#39;s a question mark. Processing industry can never make a product more healthy. Our traditional way is alwayd better. And I have noticed in bangalore more loose milk seller selling milk after I came in here since last 3 yrs. And all these happened during lockdown. Yes in only smaller area of Bangalore where we supply our dairy products...But this can happen anywhere around the world....,

Amul milk and ice cream is more like a secondary availability in states outside Gujarat and Maharashtra, and trust me, they suck. You have to live without amul to really value it",

19372,nnwqtZiYMxQ,Amul&#39;s biggest profitable decision was to give more ads on DD network whose viewers were boosted to a very high percentage in COVID times due to re-telecasting Ramayana and Mahabharata.,

19383,nnwqtZiYMxQ,The question is: how cow was used for profits?? Isn&#39;t cow sacred in hinduism?,

19398,nnwqtZiYMxQ,What an amazing video.,
19399,nnwqtZiYMxQ,the video is irrelevant and read news for some knowledge,
19400,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Excellent video. Two points: 1. Contract farming could still be exploitive as the farmer bears the risk of reduced production and yet selling at lower than market price. During surplus production, &#39;quality&#39; clause is loophole that could be exploited by the buyers to avoid buying all the produce the farmer makes. 2. The lack of legal validity of MSP was supposed to be counterbalanced by a govt buyer, the Food Corporation of India which is assured to be outside Cartals because it is not a private entity. The concept of Govt owned corporation to break monopolies or cartels is used in some countries eg France and is anathema in others eg USA. India belonged to former group with companies like BSNL, FCI, AI etc existing to prevent monopoly and cartelization. The current govt seems  ideologically inclined towards dismantling this model.",
19401,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Excellent video....Thankyou so much...,
19402,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Best explanation video i have seen on this topic 🙌🏻,
19403,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Fantastic explanation. Thank you Sir 🙏,
19404,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Regulators work only and only for safeguarding profits of the companies they are supposed to regulate and their interest from all litigations,
19405,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Hi bro, is there any hindi version of this channel? Please share.<br>While you explore and share so important facts, rural people may not understand or doesnt even listen being in English. On top of that insane propganda on rural area.",
19406,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"What happens when the MSP IS too low because of the inflation and other aspects like the cost of farming ,machinery, wages  is also increased a lot?",
19407,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Why is the government reluctant to implement MSP, or better yet what are the options available to us as a whole , from the pov of the farmers , govt , and consumers ?",
19408,76w6GQ1vs1Y,I only discovered your channel a few weeks back. I thought you&#39;re new . Doing great job brother,
19409,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Pl restrict yourself to English for south indians like me.,
19410,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Why you are giving misinformation....<br>Are you paid?<br><br>MSP stands for a price which is not forced on buyer but it&#39;s a choice given to farmer that if you are not getting this price then come to me, our FCI will buy at this price.<br>APMC created many cartels at each center but without this there would be only two cartel  Adani and Ambani...right?",
19411,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Food for thought, <br>    What if the Government fixes a maximum profit margin(percentage markup from purchase) for the corporates and an MRP, this way neither the farmers nor the consumers are exploited.",
19412,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Very Nice and clear......,
19413,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Brother, the agricultural produce quality cannot be defined objectively.",
19414,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Very nice explanation 🙏,
19415,76w6GQ1vs1Y,And this is an endless problem so unless each one in each generation learns this and how to balance everything <i>_</i>,

19421,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Very nicely explained,
19422,76w6GQ1vs1Y,There is not perfect thing exist<br>Govt should improve there amendment not to end it,
19423,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Stop that background music man.,
19424,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Wow. First video that helped me understand the importance of the issue.,
19425,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Contract Farming is a norm in the livestock development, at least in Poultry. It happens without any regulation, and they are actually protected to some extent.",
19426,76w6GQ1vs1Y,I am also a Farmer in Maharashtra...and Here is no compulsion to sell produce only in apmc...We usually sell it in our farm...So what govt. Achieve by that provision,
19427,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Absolutely wonderful video and spot on, Ganesh! However, I have one quick addition/counterpoint to this. Making MSPs a norm for 20 odd crops is practically non-viable for the government since rice and wheat are predominantly the largest in the market. MSP acts as a back-up safety net mechanism if the rates fall well below threshold, and MSP was primarily introduced to reduce the exploitative nature of middlemen and also at a time when India faced acute food shortages. Policies in times of surplus food cannot be the same as back-up plans, which is why the govt. cannot bear the grunt of always ensuring MSP in a time where private players have become inevitable like you said. MSP is usually much higher than market rates tbh, and higher MSP also fuels high crop inflation, thereby hurts economic growth. That said, the trade-off in deciding/regulating the MSP by the govt. for each crop is a ridiculously hard but a necessary task to be done.",
19428,76w6GQ1vs1Y,👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏,
19429,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Your more frequent uploads have made this my go to channel for news with a splash of entertainment at the start.. Keep it up!!! A lot has changed and that&#39;s on everything but the truth is I don&#39;t even care much about bullish or bearish market anymore because  Bryan Anderson got me covered as I am comfortably  making  13.1B T C monthly......,
19430,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Brilliant!,
19431,76w6GQ1vs1Y,1st time i understood about farm bill. Thank q,
19432,76w6GQ1vs1Y,If we say APMC has loophole then how that is passed in parliament and being followed now?,
19433,76w6GQ1vs1Y,There is loophole in any new system. if identified find a solution to close it and that&#39;s how every system is evolving. If we thing about only possibilities of loopholes then we end doing nothing and stay with old system for ever. This is will lead to another issue in coming years. So something is better than nothing and keep monitoring any loopholes and block it with amendment.,
19434,76w6GQ1vs1Y,you bring up very significant topics with such deep explanation of the concept all together in your video&#39;s. Thanks man for giving your precious time to create awareness in  societies. You are amazing:),
19435,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Very good analysis, it&#39;s hurting that  it has been revoked.. Farmers ko aamir banne nahi denge",

19439,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Thank you so much 🙏<br>For such a knowledge based video<br>I too support Contract Farming with Proper Regulations<br>Jai Hind,
19440,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Please make video data privacy bill in India,
19441,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Farmers do grow crops by taking loan from the buyers which is a common thing and their loan gets deducted when they sell their crops but this laws will end that system so they can&#39;t get loans . Most of the farmers have already took loan from bank so no more loan how will they get money to store crops,
19442,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Bro, you forgot to tellwhat happens if the quality deviates a little from the set standards of starbucks like companies? You forgot to look at the history of companies like starbucks in India on how secured are their farmers? <br>You analysed good on theoretical aspects but missed basic ground realities terribly.",
19443,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Why did the bill restricted the farmers to seek justice in courts in case of their exploitation? Why is there no MSP gurantee if the prospects are so fruitful? Why the jurisdiction was limited upto an IAS officer? Doesnt that answers the very intent behind the law? Can you analyse what was next to happen with farmers?,
19444,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Wonderful video 👏👏👏 lots of words of praise... For your hard work😃,

19460,76w6GQ1vs1Y,This bill was taken back. 😭😭. NaMo government only brings only good bill they don&#39;t know how to implement the laws. From CAA to Farm Bills.,
19461,76w6GQ1vs1Y,hahaha... a big slap on bjp bhakts face....,
19462,76w6GQ1vs1Y,The Farmer&#39;s union wanted to take the bill back completely. Nothing to be applied from the three laws. If there were these issues then why wasn&#39;t it sorted in 15 rounds of talks?? Are you also implying the govt wanted to ruin the farmers??,
19463,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Excellent explannation... Your explannation forced me to listen entire video..,

19466,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Thank you so much for this video❤️,
19467,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Best explanation!,
19468,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"I must add that reversibility occurs not because we are &#39;addicted&#39;, but because the people AROUND us adjust their expectations. Can you now use the excuse that you can&#39;t work for some time today because you the broadband isn&#39;t working (talking of employees working from home)? No. They expect you to use the hotspot. Now how will you live without mobile data? In fact, this work from home concept started because of mobile data. Without it, nobody would consider home broadband reliable enough for office work!",
19469,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Wonderful unbiased report... Well Done <br><br>1) MSP if implemented with Appropriate Reviews Periodically then this Assurance will protect the Farmers hence he will not Hoard by unnecessarily store in Paid Warehouses again another cost  burden and Buyers cannot form cartel to exploit the farmers and eventually farmers also cannot exploit the buyers - Win-Win situation <br><br>2) Corporates have sophisticated Lawyer Services / Consultants Who Could Come up with not easily Comprehend able Legal Terms and Concepts to the farmers, Govt. Political party lobbies farmers cannot withstand on the other hand poor farmers have nothing in their hand to bargain and/or balance the unfair Advantages &amp; Leverages Corporates may eventually have in the form of Lifestyle/ Business &amp; Agriculture ecosystem changes which he explained with ola taxi concept <br><br>2) Then farmers may be forced to modify/ upgrade the quality of produce by pursuading to invest in technologies/ machinery equipments thereby to get loans with different incomprehensible interest rates and collateral concepts risking farmers society to severe stress and may cause everything to give up farming and their farm lands to corporates to step in acquiring the land held as collateral thereby opening a Pandora box luring other farmers to sell their land at an attractive price initially &amp; forcing the small and surrounded land owners to sell at very unfair exploitative price... This would turn a whole society of farmers into exile leaving their land (once fed them and the entire nation if not the wider world) behind them in the hands of Corporate Exploits and big Richer Business people.<br><br>After the honeymoon with the corporate cash from land sale These people may become unskilled and unemployed and poverty may force these unemployed people to realize they all of them one by one were systematically Cheated by the prevailing system in the society and may turn angry against the society and may lead to violence and civil unrest which certainly put a nation at risk of lawlessness and disrupt to the economy leads to no confidence among society leads to instability and capital fly off inflation and civil unrest to civil war.... With these eventualities Risk in mind policy makers and strategists and bureaucrats should give thorough and multiple dimension factors and analysis before giving to corporate lobbyists and media propaganda and hence would need to talk and assure the fearing farmers and explain to them in lay Man terms and then properly drawn out decision should be taken. People should be very very patient and should check their own emotions under control and hope for the dialogue with relevant stakeholders to get Win-Win situation for all and the nation.",

19489,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Such great efforts have been put in the video 👏👏👏,
19490,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"If govt brings in MSP below which a Pvt company can&#39;t procure farm produce and on the other end if govt regulates the prices at which the companies can sell those produce to the consumers such that there would be ceiling prices above which the produce can&#39;t be sold, there&#39;d be a very little profit margin for the procuring companies. There would be very less scope for such companies to grow as their revenue/profit will remain more or less stagnant over the years. Even taking inflation and thereby according change in MSP and ceiling prices into consideration, the situation doesn&#39;t change much. In such a scenario, why any pvt company would want to participate, as their sole motivation is growing business and making profits, which is being curbed through such policy. A growing profit-making business not only benefits the company owners but also benefits society through increasing employment/wages and indirectly benefits the shareholders of the company as share prices go up. Considering the merits of the proposed amendments in the farm bills as discussed in the video as well as the probable demerits I mentioned above, govt may set up a few companies like IRCTC, IRFC, BSNL etc, which are not exactly profit-oriented as they monopolise (with the exception of BSNL currently) their respective markets to a certain extent. I said a few companies instead of a single company because it would generate limited competition rather than a monopoly in agro produce market as all the companies would have to comply with the govt regulated MSP and ceiling prices but they would have the freedom to set up their own prices within that range. Hence, the freedom to sell and buy depending upon the price/quality of products would also be transferred to the farmers and consumers respectively.",

19536,r5OCFaXqS5I,"I think everyone here who is talking about the taste, has never tried other instant noodles. Try koka brand stir fry noodles n let’s see if you stand your ground. N another thing is that you just got used to the taste. Once you eat other instant noodles for more than 3 or 4 times, you will not think that Maggi’s taste is superior.",

19546,r5OCFaXqS5I,I don’t think it has so much to do with marketing. I’ve not seen a Maggie advertisement in a lifetime at least on a tv what brings me back to Maggie is it’s taste and pricing nothing else which it’s contemporary just can’t match with. Idc if Kylie Jenner sells it.,

Japan was getting wheat cheaply from US subsidies but they didn&#39;t have sufficient rice or other grains used to make the flour of traditional noodles.

19560,r5OCFaXqS5I,"My mom never encouraged me to have Maggi. I did receive free maggi packets at school back in 1990s, for answering quiz questions. But my mom used to give those to kaamwali. But I only started consuming Maggi when I was in hostel and the mess food was an absolute mess. The only reason why I like Maggi is because of it&#39;s taste. Period. I also like Yippie noodles. Their taste is splendid too, especially the double spicey noodles that come in purple color packing. I consume Yippie noodles more than Maggi. <br><br>Let me give you an example. I was once eating maggi. My 2 year old son came to me and was sitting beside me watching TV while I was eating. He smelled the Maggi and asked me to give him a spoonful. When I gave him, he loved it. Later, I also gave him, Top Ramen, Tom Ramen curry, patanjali noodles, knorr noodles, yippie &amp; wai wai. He only loved yippie and Maggi. That&#39;s how my son started consuming noodles. Just for taste. My wife somehow got my son off the instant noodle habit.",
19561,r5OCFaXqS5I,Hey there<br><br>Maybe there are all business tactics according to you (for the reach)<br><br>But I tasted many instant noodles but maggi is the closest to my heart because of its taste <br><br>Maybe there can be marketing for the reach I mean to repeatedly buy it the product needs to satisfy the buyer <br><br>So more than the marketing skills a product needs to be worthy to buy it again ..as a buyer I always think of the taste while purchasing noodles that&#39;s it not the advt or bla bla,
19562,r5OCFaXqS5I,Thank you sir 🙏❤😃,

That is why imperfect is beautiful.<br><br>	• Regardless of how perfection is lucrative to look, it&#39;s just tapping onto your insecurities, to convince you to be something .someone else will be making billions of money from it, sometimes in the form of cosmetics, iphone, cigarettes , trends , designer cloths , blah blah blah.

19804,yxC9kgS8lnQ,no point in comparing REEBOK.....after its buyout by ADIDAS it would play 2nd fiddle...and the indian arm was down with scandal of misappropriation...but yes KUDOS to PUMA,
19805,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Puma products sold in india are low quality<br>They are made in india to keep the price lower and hence heavy compromise of quality .,
19806,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"Untill Kohli step down as brand ambassador of Puma, no one can beat Puma in India ♥️🔥",
19807,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Where is Reebok.. ??!!,
19808,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Simple reason quality and price goes hand in hand with puma rest other miss this combination,
19809,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"Brother hats off🙌, how you make such brilliant spot on case studies yet not so lengthy, makes me admire more.",
19810,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Anyone notice he himself  had the t-shirt of  kings brand Wrogan 🥵,
19811,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Puma quality is coming down and designs are pathetic..,
19812,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"In retrospect, everything seems so obvious 😁",
19813,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Asics all the way.,
19814,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Watching only for King 👑🔥,
19815,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Koi puma ko seriously nhi leta wo toh king kohli k liye le lete hai,
19816,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Style = Nike<br>Comfort = Adidas<br>Neither but cheap = Puma <br>in super competitive and price sensitive market like India its obviously gonna be Puma.,
19817,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Student of the year also sponsored by puma,
19818,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Puma is comparatively budget friendly,
19819,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Because puma is cheap,
19820,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Because of king 👑👑🔥🐉 kohli,
19821,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Fun fact founder of adidas and puma were brothers,
19822,yxC9kgS8lnQ,For over 20 years I preferred Puma in general over other sports brands.,
19823,yxC9kgS8lnQ,NIKE ...Always,
19824,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Nike go BIG or go HOME. wait when shoe industry in india crosses billion at sports level. if india hosts olympics then nike can come big!<br>adidas and puma are fantastic too. german offer top quality always.<br>----------------------<br>EDGE STILL GOES TO NIKE. NORMALLY AMERICANS ARE NOT KNOWN FOR ELEGANCY UNLIKE EUROPEANS. <br>BUT THINGS CHANGED LAST 20 YEARS.<br><br>SO NIKE STARTED INCORPORATING FASHION WHICH WAS ONLY POPULAR IN HOLLYWOOD AND NYK AREA AND SFO.<br>ITALIAN FASHION PRODUCTS. THEN THEY STARTED GIVING TOUCH IN FASHION ON SHOE LEVEL AND OTHER PRODUCTS  UNIKE GERMAN PRODUCTS WHO ALWAYS HAVE EYE ON ELEGANCY NOT AS FUSSY AS ITALIANS  AND FRENCH THOUGH!<br>-----------<br>SO WHILE ADIDAS AND PUMA MAY LOOK HIGHLY FASHIONABLE THEY ARE NOT AS RUGGED AS NIKE.<br>WHO ALSO HAVE CUTTING EDGE FASHIONABLE SHOES THESE DAYS( JORDAN BRAND IS THE MOST SOLD IN THE WORLD).<br><br>IF SALVATORE FERRIGAMO GOES TO WORK THOSE SHOES WOULD COST 3 TO 4 TIMES WHAT NIKE AND ADIDAS CHARGE.<br><br>DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!,
19825,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"NOBODY BEATING NIKE. PUMA AND ADIDAS ARE AS EXPENSIVE AS NIKE. BUT NIKE IS DIFFERENT. THEY ARE TAKING THEIR TIME IN INDIA. NIKE ATHLETIC SHOES ARE A RAGE IN INDIA AS NONE OFFER THOSE KIND OF VARIETY ETC.<br><br>INDIA IS NOT SOCCER( NO INTERNATIONAL SUPERSTARS) AND BASKETBALL CRAZY. SO NIKE SHOES ARE NOT WORN BY ALL, AS THEY CAN BE QUITE EXPENSIVE.<br><br>ADIDAS EQUALLY EXPENSIVE THOUGH. PUMA IS MORE STYLISH AND CAN GET EXPENSIVE!",
19826,yxC9kgS8lnQ,meanwhile  puma jitna india mai kamata hai utna football teams ki advertising mai spent krta h,
19827,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"Dude, Campus will beat the foreign brands not only in India but the world steadily.",
19828,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Indian football team captain sunil chethri is also a ambassador of puma india 2019 to 2022..,
19829,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"First of all, I do not think PUMA has dominated others at all",
19830,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"I dont think that, for me all three are neck to neck, <br>Edit:- personal fav Adidas",
19831,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Addidas is not true to size and is not worth.. The costs of products are 5x to the actual value,
19832,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"You can get a good looking good quality sneaker from PUMA for 2700, a shoe like that from nike would cost you 10k, And that makes the difference (besides virat kohlis&#39;s immense presence)",
19833,yxC9kgS8lnQ,I used to buy Reebok shoes because of Dhoni,
19834,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Nike and adidas are sport brands and they stick to their core value unlike others..,
19835,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Well still I prefer Nike and Adidas,
19836,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Kuch samajh nahin aaya but sun k accha laga. 🙂,
19837,yxC9kgS8lnQ,I buy puma products only bcuz of Kohli 😊,
19838,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Beacusy of virat,

19840,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Puma become More successful in India by making virat Kohli as their brand ambassador 🔥🔥,
19841,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"Also one more point , Puma and adidas were cheaper than Nike .",
19842,yxC9kgS8lnQ,In 2010 reebok is a sub brand of Adidas...,
19843,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Nike destroyed? What a joke 🤣,
19844,yxC9kgS8lnQ,I think the best factor is virat Kohli 🎉,
19845,yxC9kgS8lnQ,That is called power of king Kohli in India,
19846,yxC9kgS8lnQ,puma shoes are awesome.and generally common people also buy it,
19847,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"I have used Puma, adidas and Nike, Puma is price effective i think that&#39;s the reason it is doing good in the market, otherwise if you buy a shoes  from these brands say like at 2K then quality of Nike shoes are way too good. My point is that probably Nike is targeting to make a best product and not just profit.",
19848,yxC9kgS8lnQ,One point could have been added concerning the online shopping experience. Puma&#39;s website and app experience is miles ahead of what I experienced with the apps of Nike &amp; Addidas.,
19849,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Nike to nike hain🔥,
19850,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Well known brand + cheap price compared to competition is what taken Puma to summit,
19851,yxC9kgS8lnQ,In India there is nothing they don’t sell prime products in India they know how poor India is,
19852,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Indian brands need to enter this war,
19853,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"Nike, Apple, General Motors, Ford all does the Same thing they aren&#39;t exclusive for Indian Consumers.<br><br>Next in line is Tommy and Calvin.

19856,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Reebok owned by shaq the greatest business man iv seen 💯,
19857,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Acics shoes are best for sport shoes,
19858,yxC9kgS8lnQ,I have been using puma products last 6 years. In terms of making quality  puma is far better than Adidas and Nike.,
19859,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Price most important factor,
19860,yxC9kgS8lnQ,No one can beat NIKE and the quality which it provides ❤❤ !!,
19861,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"Nike is Nike,no offence to other brands",

Talking about Puma in sports, they literally have the worst jersey design, from football to cricket. They&#39;re horrible.  Have been using Nike and Adidas products from very long now and they both easily feel far superior to Puma.",
19867,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Adidas shoes are way comfortable and have great quality than pumas,
19868,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"I have used 18 puma cricket shoes  and my friends to , we all have same problem it not COMFORTABLE it hard it is NARROW  you will twist you ankle easily , this company is alive because of SIR Kohli",
19869,yxC9kgS8lnQ,"Excellent research Think school......i never knew Reebok was the leader in Indian market....My 2 cents to your research.....the center to success is product....Nike has jordans and excellent innovation which never made it to indian market...Thanks to ecommerce they are visible sparingly.....Nike is selling the same shoes in India which it was since i was 14 and now i am 34.....Puma on the contarary understood Indian market much better with innovative designs, experimented with colors and collaboration with ferrari, bmw etc. which was a big hit....keep doing the great job Think School....",
19870,yxC9kgS8lnQ,After collaborating with Virat Kohli Puma took offffffffff,
19871,yxC9kgS8lnQ,Adidas literally killed Reebok in India and around the world.,
