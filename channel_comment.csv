86,hHGlDhJkDKI,"I would like to share my dilemma here and I am pretty sure that perhaps it&#39;s the same with a lot of people. Today, the e-commerce sites sell various products at prices cheaper than the local brick and mortar stores. So, most of us end up buying those things online. Whereas the business for these small stores are diminishing by the day and they are downing the shutters. A classic example would be the bookstores. Nowadays any title is available at a higher discount at any online site. So its completely reasonable from the customer point of view to buy them online. But business for these small stores are also important and as accentuated by this video, they need to be supported. Would be very interesting to know to your thoughts and views on this.",

310,A1k62pSQ7so,These selling concepts are applicable in lower-income countries as I see some advertisements for washing powders in Vietnam are sold from 5000 dong which is $0.22 in USD which caters the need of the large customer base of Vietnamese families from a lower income category. It is hardly seen in high developed countries as most of them are affordable to buy in bottles and factories are willing to produce so to support the fixed costs in economies of scale.,
311,A1k62pSQ7so,Isn&#39;t that case is just opposite with the brands like Cadbury they increase the amount of the chocolate with increase in its price. Like five rupees of chocolate have lesser amount than eighty rupees of chocolate. And they make more profit in small packets than large.,
312,A1k62pSQ7so,You missed the main point here is that Bcoz of Chik shampoo  inroduced 50 paisa shampoo then all companies came down they also started giving 50 paisa  1 rupee shampoo sachets that much success chik got but the great thing is still they are providing that 50 paisa shampoo even though all brands little bit increased and one more thing is that  before chik shampoo brand came into the market already  sachets  were available but cost is high all shampoo  brands sachets starts from 1.50 paisa to 3 Rs  i remember bcoz till it comes we were using soap nuts due to big  family but chik helped many families <br>Don&#39;t miss the main points next time,

Also for farms and lands with substantial area, the governments can rationalise the cost of installation over 5 years and reduce their load on say as much as they can...

After his father&#39;s death, CKR started his own company Cavinkare and his brother still run the Velvette international. Ratan Tata jest before his retirement as chairman visited velvette International office in chennai to pay homage of this inventor. Kindly do proper research, just like that do not change the history.

They cannot accurately dispense 5 mL. They end up sqeezing 7-8 mL. Sachet is the minimum quantity required to deliver the result. Hence, the profit is quite huge for the company when they buy a bottle.<br>Another one, when u look at an ad of a toothpaste, they show sqeezing the toothpaste along the whole length of the brush.

There could be some extra tax to pay on fresh vegetables but that is   balanced out with discount rate of packed items, no investment of my human resource time, I don&#39;t need to give cash money to my staff(reduced corruption),  also I see vegetable rates are low, especially the exotic one(mostly cos of farm to fork model).",

413,-NtB3rf8paE,"I would like to add some points as a delivery person with Zomato.<br>I have delivered food to a person in a remote location 12 km away from the restaurant ordered from her daughter in a foreign location at the peak time. Is it possible for any restaurant to do the same I don&#39;t think so.<br>Don&#39;t forget birthday cakes. Sweets and other goodies delivered to your loved ones via Zomato in less than two hours times was it possible before.<br>The payment may not be good but it provides employment opportunity to anyone and flexibility to work at your convenient was this type of work possible before no it was not.<br>A newly opened restaurant has access to different customer in 12 km ratio of the location, the restaurant can be a cloud kitchen &amp; could be located in a remote location . They don&#39;t have to look after any supply ,as  Zomato with supplied them all the raw materials.<br>It could be a lazy Sunday morning or a busy day at the work, no matter the price we are all going to fire up the app to get the food delivered at the house from any restaurant listed.<br>Obviously Zomato or swiggy model is here to stay and nothing will stop them from profitability",

435,-NtB3rf8paE,Ii am restaurant owner 43% of my revenue is eaten by Zomato as advertising cost and commission but still it is not profitable. I order very few items from Zomato less than 15% of my inventory purchase because there is bonding with old suppliers and it is hard to break with them as of now they are giving us a little discount after acquiring the market they will increase price as these big giant companies are not trustworthy as they did with commissions earlier is used to give 12% as commissions now 28%+gst and advertising cost also. They are giving some items in low cost but buying whole from them is not good we have seen them at charging commissions.,
436,-NtB3rf8paE,jaroor doobega,
437,-NtB3rf8paE,Zomato is creating a supply chain for dominating the food market.<br>This plan is something like Amazon.<br>If it worked the investment will return a lot.,
438,-NtB3rf8paE,Hyperpure has good products. I order daily for our restaurant bhojanyan. Only issue is about the delivery time. 70% of the time deliveries are late but you get a good rate plus good product.,

455,-NtB3rf8paE,"Borosil Renewables Wow, I have already purchased when it was trading @Price of 40 per share,<br>And still holding it",
456,-NtB3rf8paE,Eventually at the end The supply of raw material through Zomato hyperpure will be based on farming. A bad year or a bad season and who know that Zomato doesn&#39;t able to supply on time. And if the restaurant have only one supplier so as to minimise the default or late payment - they will suffer massively due to the uneven supply,
457,-NtB3rf8paE,"Buddy, you changed my perspective. Next time when I&#39;m ordering on zomato, I&#39;ll definitely be thinking more about the restaurant I&#39;m ordering from.",
458,-NtB3rf8paE,The zomato IPO was a sham .. and so many of the startup IPOs are looking like that.. These startups dont have any feasible plan on becoming profitable after taking millions and billions in VC money. But what they do get is high valuation just becasue they are talked about so much. Hence now we see the investors are getting back their money through the public which put in money for the IPO. Foreign investors getting their money back at Indian public risk.. seems like something is wrong here,

499,-NtB3rf8paE,"Ganesh - As usual, very good information you provided in your video. Great man, keep up the good work in educating common people like me. My question is what if Swiggy or Amazon or any new company come up with super pumped PE money and give discounts more than Zomato. See you need to understand one point, Zomato already went public and it is under tremendous pressure to perform. Zomato Hyperpure is directly linked to delivery where restaurants are associated with them. With new companies providing more discounts, people can move to new players and so as restaurants. If it happens then what is the motivation for a restaurant owner to stick to Zomato delivery and their Hyperpure? My next question is Zomato taking some stake in Curefit - Dont you think a capital (?? i mean PE money) misallocation? Infoedge started investments in start-ups in early 2010 from the cash proceeds/profits but Zomato is taking public money and investing in different start-up where those companies can go bust. Pls share your feedback on these 2 questions. Thanks, Dara - u r channel followe from Oslo.",

561,wzsYAuxhxSw,Fool.,
562,wzsYAuxhxSw,"I attended a business meet of Amway (online on zoom)- their latest pitch is: You are using soaps, oils, toothpaste, etc. if you are using a world class product and share that with people in your life, the money you save from the distribution channel, and  in cases even advertising cost, can be shared by the consumers.<br><br>The products are wonderful as I use Nutrilite. <br>Please do an updated series on Amway (as they don&#39;t give free samples to my best knowledge) and still they are a billion dollar company.<br><br>Did anyone notice Shri Sai Baba blessing us through this video (the pic on the wall)?",

584,wzsYAuxhxSw,just an suggestion ....u should look at camera lens not at laptop screen to get perfect  look for videos,
585,wzsYAuxhxSw,People like my parents had to buy the merch then they had to convince the people to use the product. They bought the sales meeting tickets for other people just to listen the seminar which cost them around 400-700 Rs  per person.

695,h7xd2PqtglQ,"Wuihh, ytber India guys",
696,h7xd2PqtglQ,"Nicely covered though the entire story, just one correction, at the time of ban CPO exports was also banned. Please be double assure as this leads to misleading statements.",
697,h7xd2PqtglQ,"Actually a little bit wrong but the gist of it is right. Region of heavy palm oil producers are Sumatra and Kalimantan. The consumers are mainly in java and sumatra. The big problem why the price shot up is cartelism between palm oil companies which are dominated by few companies, which are trying to get as many profit as possible when the price shot up just before ramadan (high consumption period). So the government under pressure of the public banned the export. Miraculously the supply return to normal afterward.",
698,h7xd2PqtglQ,A,
699,h7xd2PqtglQ,"Indonesia palm oil farm is concentrated in Sumatra and Kalimantan island. <br>Problem of rising palm oil price was not due to inconnectivity between island, but  due to greedyness of palm oil factory oligarchs, corruptive government, mismanagement, and top leadership policy.<br>All palm oil company has Public Service Obligation (PSO) to domestic market (Indonesia market first). But they violated as sky rocketing price outside country (import) had blinded their eye and hearth as well as erase normal logical thingking by selling all palm oil stock outisde country and forgeting the PSO.<br>High price palm oil was also benefiting to palm farmer. But banning on export palm oil product suddently plunged down palm fruit price and suffering the farmer. Meanwhile it like pairy tale story for oligarch as they buy palm fruit very cheap but sell the palm oil very high, because gov still allow to exporting crude palm oil...a crazy and blunder  policy in the middle of high palm cooking oil in the country",

805,SGIKsejp7-0,"honestly, there is vast difference if you use a Gillette Mach 3 and a Gillette Fusion. I get very thick beard and so can tell. Mostly when you want a closer chave against the grain which most blades are unable to do including Dollar Shave or it&#39;s Indian counterpart Bombay Shaving Company. Gillette is superbly smooth and hold true to their ad &quot;Shave ulti karein ya seedhi&quot;. <br><br>Gillette does sell razors atbdircheap but blades at high price but if you compare a Gillette blade with a similar blade of a different brand, Gillette does last longer.

814,SGIKsejp7-0,"It was more of a woke driven suicide by Gillette. Having made a fortune off bearded men over decades, Gillette thought it fit to lecture those very fund providers on their &quot;toxicity&quot;.

826,SGIKsejp7-0,"Also Gillette spat on the face of their target customers in the name of wokeism. That lost them a lot of customers. Many switched to DSC and others, like me, to a safety razor.",
827,SGIKsejp7-0,"Hi.  Like the moral of your story. I am sooo happy Gillette is dying. P&amp;G has a dirty marketing strategy of killing other brands.

843,SGIKsejp7-0,I stopped buying any Gillette products after their stupid woke culture commercials.  Gillette lost a large part of their market share due to their stupid commercials.  Other companies produce a good product without preaching woke ideas to men who just want a good razor.,
844,SGIKsejp7-0,"They&#39;ve dug themselves so deep with that &quot;Toxic masculinity&quot; commercial that they&#39;re never getting out of it. Dollar and many other brands were waiting for the opportunity to disrupt gillette market share, that Gillette themselves gave them, and they took it. Customers aren&#39;t stupid.",

860,SGIKsejp7-0,"Did you intentionally ignored the fact that sales and reputation of Gillette stooped low significantly after publishing a woke &quot;toxic-masculinity&quot; ad in 2019? There was even a global boycott Gillette movement, DSC along other razor companies benefitted greatly during this time since customers began to look for alternatives. The biggest business lesson is &quot;Go woke get broke&quot;",
861,SGIKsejp7-0,"I beat both Gillette and DSC. Bought a traditional cut throat razor at INR 275 (about $ 3.5) - a one time investment - and a pack of 50 two-sided blades for INR 150 ($2) which would last to eternity. My shaving ritual, twice a weak, starts with a tumbler of hot water, a white napkin, an ordinary shaving cream and a concave mirror. I turn on a classical tune on mobile (and loud on the music system when the wifey is not around!!!) and soak the face, apply leather and the razor glides like a knife through butter. Had a few cuts initially, but got perfection after a month of usage. Takes longer, 20 minutes or so, but I get a super shave while the music ends.       üòá",
862,SGIKsejp7-0,"Someone gifted me a Turbo Mach 3 razor about 2 years ago. When I asked for a replacement  for my worn out one, they quoted an obscene amount. I switched back to the good old razor which uses safety blades. I am convinced that this is more economical since it has four sharp edges compared to the one of the much advertised Gillette&#39;s. The gifted one has been lying there in the box ever since.",
863,SGIKsejp7-0,The lesson that I learned is that there is nothing like &quot;Customer loyalty&quot;. They will turn to somewhere else as soon as they find a better option.,
864,SGIKsejp7-0,"Awesome, also I think the future is going to be Trimmers, there is a definite behavioral shift towards it. I started with Gillette and continued until I started using trimmers and I have not shaved in 5 years, only use trimmers now. The last I shaved was on my wedding day.",
865,SGIKsejp7-0,"As a wise man once said, &quot;Everything woke, turns to shit&quot;<br><br>Gillette got the taste of hiring gender neutral, oppressed, compressed, bench-pressed left-capitalism hating wokes as brand managers and I am just sipping the tears from their downfall. I wish they either go back to basics, issue an apology or disappear completely.",

There are already too many engineering graduates produced in India with majority of them unemployable. Moreover, ministers in India want it&#39;s people to remain half educated so that they don&#39;t question their judgement. Only thing that can save India is ruthless population control and mass employment generating industries like textile, mfg etc..",
964,5JKTbU6RnA0,The first change we should adopt to our education system which is a must is to give compulsory science &amp; maths education till +2 rather than till std 10 irrespective of marks or interest. Already we have aptitude exams after +2 to choose which streams one want. So the logic of not continuing science &amp; maths is bizarre. Though it&#39;s just two years of extra science &amp; maths the change will be phenomenol &amp; path breaking. Our education &amp; career choices will be much more pronounced &amp; unforced.

970,5JKTbU6RnA0,"I always thought that Indian education system is not worth my knowledge my time and money. As an open category student that time was very tough to secure a good college. Somehow I got admitted into an average college. But due to unfortunate events and critical condition of my family I had to compromise and I started working. It was full time 9-10 hrs work. After few years I had enough savings to finish my education. I passed in first class. Our college had no campus interviews. So i had to look on my own. I used to clear all rounds except the HR round where my academics was questioned due to the gap I had. And when I told them about it they use to ask me to do what I was doing earlier and this happend with all those companies where I interviewed. Even after doing passing in first grade clearing all rounds I was rejected on the basis of Gap I had and the work ai did during that Gap. My moral was all time down. But I had no option to find a solution and move on. I joined a startup consultancy firm and all was going good untill pandemic hit India. And that firm shutdown and again I was left with nothing but to wait and watch to get the situation normalised. But instead it was getting more worse and I had very few savings remaining. I had no work for months I then came across webcam modeling and became cam model. But this was very temporary and I knew I wudn&#39;t survive on it for long run. So meanwhile I started looking for other options. And I came across one luckily. I studied and did research on it for almost two years. And launched my own brand. Now I am working full time for my own brand and it&#39;s growing. Our education system failed to acknowledge my talent hence I had to do it on my own. I bet there  are so many people like me who deserves better but have to compromise due to this system. All I can say is Struggle is still on but what I learnt through all this year&#39;s, hardly any Indian University wud have taught me and I am still learning and growing. üòá‚úåÔ∏è<br>And yes thanks for this video very informative and I really appreciate your detailed analysis.

Without inventory,  and only for 15 days is serious logistical issue where India needs to focus. <br>The behind stories and corrupt selection of vendors in US and Europe led to Japanese rise. <br>Saving the capital or labor is still important in tech world as the cost reaches high and inflation ensures operational model has to be lean.<br>The question is can Indian brands follow the model. <br>Chennai the auto hub has well connected tier 1 and 2  suppliers where it is still possible to run efficient assembly line. <br>But clogged ports and highways are a problem. Customs protocol of getting sub assemblies from other states is rather tough. <br>Hence Indian SEZs should build all supply chain around each other to save costs and labor.

Air Asia India, Vistara, Air India and Air India express from which we can compare prices and also try to get the cheapest ticket fully discounted. This will be a major threat to airlines like indigo and spicejet. And also tata offers vacation packages with their hotels that include flight tickets and stay and tours. So life of a consumer becomes so much easier with this and looks attractive as well. It just takes away the tension of booking a seperate flight ticket and seperate hotel room and stuff. And also cancellation of flights are minimum to nil as integration between these 4 airlines gives a huge fleet spread where customers can be served by either one of them during an unfortunate cancellation in one airline",

Indian companies are just a product cycle management &amp; logistics company, focuses only on product appearance and brand establishment; Havells is better in this case, they at-least assembles in India.. mostly uses Chinese technology.. if they can compete in advanced countries like US, EU, China, that will prove their quality/uniqueness (indian auto/auto parts companies actually proved themselves)",

We need a really great business model for competing the business models of aviation in the West.

Big Bull (BB) is gone Raging Bull and a foolish ego to enter the Indian Aviation Market faced and facing numerous challenges. Namely aviation fuel costs, cut throat competition and cost of the choices of aircraft, range and type. AirAsia India (AAI) was doomed when it employed a non aviation CEOs for several years by the flamboyant Tony Fernandes and his crony friends from the music industry. AAI Route Planning and Slots were difficult and in short supply within the Metro Cities and Tier One Airports. Then there is the Aviation Market to regional Markets or International that requires operations for 5 years and a minimum of 15 aircraft. Aviation Fuel is so unpredictable with the war in Ukraine, DIFFICULT TO HEDGE and translates to ticket pricing affecting demand. Selling Tickets dependent on the Internet has limitations. Travel Agents are still have to be utilised in India for some years. BB has gone bananas as he has NO Experience in Aviation or Similar Industries where customer satisfaction are paramount. BB needs a Team that understands aviation.  Yeap. Cost Cutting is up to a point were the cost cutting contributes to negative value propositions. Then there is the question of setting up an MRO or outsourcing Not forgetting Start Up Costs of enormous investments. The Biggest Obstacle is the Indian Government Polices and Taxation.

1864,RoD3kThcl6U,"Good video in principle. But there is a flaw in argument. When Indigo leases the aircraft, the lesser will take into account all cost the airplane will incur (running cost, maintenance, depreciation), plus profit. So operating the airplane in a sale - lease back approach is always costlier than if you would be the owner. The advantage, as you rightly point out, is that the cost are to be covered by the generated incomes, thus affecting cash-flow.<br>The other flaw in argument is that it increases the net profit. This is not always the case, as depreciation is always taken as an expense, reducing thus the gross profit before tax.",

1906,X-CLMLrHcqU,"<b>History repeating like during WW2 and WW1/Spanish plague.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now under WW3 and a corona virus pandemic. Hitler used Zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the fumant removed.  It causes symptoms like corona virus.  Look up in the sky you will see planes spraying your cities!  Hitler attacked Russia, just like what is happening now.  The British Empire had no legal male Heir so they imported a fake one from Germany.  The British Queen&#39;s husband &quot;Prince Philip&quot; renounced his German citizenship, became a Greek citizen and as a Greek citizen moved to Britain gaining citizenship there.  After gaining citizenship, he was appointed a Duke, out of thin air and then as a Prince and married Queen Elizabeth.  &quot;Prince Philip&quot; took the name of the Queen, not the other way, as it usually is done, where a wife takes the husband&#39;s name.  The British Empire has run out of male Heirs at least twice, and they kill to suppress it.    WW2 was a way of hiding this fraud, and now WW3 is a way of hiding that illegal combines Heir. The Bible says that a male would not fail to sit on the throne.  A family name continues through the males, not the females, and Philip was a fraud.  He had become a Greek citizen to make it appear that he was a Royal from the earlier Greek dynasty.</b>  Total theater.  <b>The Catholic Empires of the Roman Empire form one leg and the UK(British controlled) Empire forms the other leg of the Roman Empire, with the King Pope Francis as the ruler of the whole system.  He has a triple teired crown with 666 on it in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  He is a King of the city state of the Vatican(the Vatican is the smallest Country in the world), Rome Italy, and is mentioned in Revelation, Apocalypse, 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions that this Empire is responsible for all those slaughtered on earth.  It mention what the leaders wear, which is scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  The UK leg Royals also wear those colors, a long with Judges and Magistrates of the Crown.  They refer to this entity as the Crown.  When some one goes to court in one of the British subservient Nations, it is said that the Crown has a case against the person.</b>  Canada, Australian and others are not sovereign or free.  please read Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, and study it closely, because this Empire comes as a false system claiming to represent God, but exterminates to stay in power.  <b>1Timothy3:1-16 mentions that the one looking after a group(Church) should be a husband of one wife with obedient children.  The Pope and the Priests of the Catholic Church are forbidden to marry, and so don&#39;t even qualify, according to the very book and God they say they claim to represent(an unmarried man has no wife or children.)   The Bible&#39;s Peter&#39;s mother in-law was cured by Jesus(Yeshua).  So if Peter had a mother in law, then he had a wife as there is no other way.</b>  That is why Catholic Priest have sex with so many little boys, girls and women attendees.  <b>There was over ninety cases of Preists molesting little boys in the city of Boston, USA alone.  None of the Priests were disciplined, but were only moved to a different location, and now you know why.  The whole system is a fraud.</b>  So this organization has many false teachings.  <b>The Roman Emporer forced a combining of Biblical and Pagan beliefs, when Rome Nationalized the Church.  Rome forbid the celebration of Biblical Holy days and Sabbaths under threat of beatings, then confiscation of property and finally death.   Many beheaded or burned alive.</b>  Revelation Apocalypse 18:4 says get out of this organization &quot;my people&quot; if you don&#39;t want to receive her plagues.  <b>Freedom to communicate is under attack by Church and State, up to the point they are threatening to bomb the microprocessor production facilities.</b>  Pray for me and you, please!  <b>Russia says they have the proof that Britain was involved in at least thres major terror attacks against Russia.</b>  Would Russia bomb their own 5+ Billion pipeline, their own bridge, powerplants and Navel yards?  <b>NATO said that they would attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize their island, because Australia would feel threatened, but NATO was militarizing Ukraine, where they had bunkers full of weapons.  NATO&#39;s puppet regime in Ukraine was banning the Russian language and culture even though that was many people&#39;s only language.  The Ukrainian Capital is a Russian word until Western media changed it to hide the Russian history, as Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a recent NATO coup, which the US planned, as they told their dignitaries not to attend the Russian Olympics at that time. You could go to prison for teaching the Russian language. All opposition parties in Ukraine (banned).  Those with out blue arm bands(now yellow?) being put to death.</b>  Many US Officials had been talking about a coming war with Russia and China.  Years in advance.  <b>Donald J Trump said he couldn&#39;t answer corona virus questions claiming we are at war.</b>  Trump said that the US will soon be at war with Russia and China. <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, but are part of China, as acknowledged by most nations of the world till recently.</b>  NATO is planning to do to Taiwan and China what they did to Ukraine and Russia.  <b>Britain fighting for Democracy in Ukraine?  Britain has had two or three Prime Ministers that have not been ellected, trying to help the naked Emporer.</b>  Think!  <b>Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband&#39;s attack is a fraud.  The Police changed and contradicted the events multiple times and it makes no sense.</b>  Corona virus is a code name for information that exposes the crown(Government/Royals).  A vaccine is computer/electronic device program that deletes information from your view(anti virus software).  Symptoms for a biological virus comes from being gased, radiated or sprayed in your environment.  <b>Planes fly in parallel patterns, causing heating of your environment and breathing difficulties.  Like Hitler killed by Zyklon B gas, so now they use a deadly gas in incubators.</b>  Donald J Trump said he would put Hilary R Clinton in prison when ellected for starting a war and genocide in Libya, but when he got in power did nothing.  Americans have started many unjust wars.  <b>America/NATO is about to start wars with Ethiopia, Haiti, Taiwan, Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the list goes on.  NATO Countries have invaded more than half of all sovereign Nations on earth, in the last 30 years.</b>  When you print money on paper and then go buy things with it, and it is not backed by any thing then you have to attack a lot of people to keep the scheme going.  <b>New Central Bank digital currencies(CBDCs) will be centralized and backed only by cow farts and trust, where as Bitcoin is decentralized and backed by gold.  Bitcoin/gold and silver came under a major attack by the crown(governments).  The digital currencies will create a M.O.B. type system, that if you get in government cross hairs you will be shut out of the system just like Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Russia and so on and so on.  If they do it to a complete Country, then they will have no problem doing it to individuals.  Canada confiscated people&#39;s money breaking international law.</b>  Rome enters a Country, exterminates, and keeps the remaining people&#39;s in refugee camps called Reserves.  Periodically they thin out the population.  They usually make a lot of noise about sport team names with Native names and how people are trying to erase their names, so as to hide the real erasure of actual peoples.  <b>Revelation 7:9, God says he would take out of all Nations and Tribes and Peoples a people for himself.  God accepts all those who accept him of all Nationalities.</b>  Donald J Trump started operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American people by military nurses.  Trump added death by electrocution, firing squad, poison gas to the already used lethal injection.   <b>Trump foretold war on Russia and China years in advance, a said no one would protect the Pope more than him.</b>  America turned it&#39;s back on God, so now he is turning his back on you.  <b>The US, Canada, Germany, Italy, Britain, Australia, Austria, Ukraine and many other Nations refused to agree and voted against a move at the United Nations to condemn Nazism.  Russia voted against Nazism.  Remember the Nazis?  They started WW2 and exterminated 12000000 human beings, often by extremely cruel means.  The Ukraine military has a entire Nazi battalion the Azov Nazi battalion.  Church leaders clearly seen in Hitler&#39;s Nazi SS footage blessing the troops before slaughters.  The Azov Steel Works was full of Nazis that surrendered to Russia, with pictures confirming their Nazi swastikas tattooed on their bodies.</b>  Ukraine banned all opposition parties and is trying to exterminate the Russian language, people and culture.  Teachers are sent to prison for teaching the Russian language in areas where most only speak Russian.  <b>Fighting for Democracy?</b>  Britain installed two Prime Ministers that were not elected.  <b>Donald J Trump used his office while President to start a business so called &quot;Truth Social&quot; that he claimed would enable free speech.  Later Mr.Trump tried to get the Justice department to stop late night hosts from talking about him.  So supposedly creating free speech over here, but attacking free speech over there.</b>  Russia and China no longer accept US fiat currency, so G7 banned Russian gold. Supposed unbiased media not allowing comments, is a mass deception and contrary to their purpose. CBDCs attacking crypto. 1933 the US confiscated gold.   For 50 years, 10 years in prison for having it, and only ended when gold was separated from backing money in 1971 now backed by cow farts. 2022 Biden bans Russian gold.

Does India feel they have the conditions to create a solar industry that is price competitive?   If so the tariffs and subsidies are of course needed to it started. But if in the end the conditions in the country is not conducive to creating a competitive solar panel industry, it will end up (as in the US) a waste of money and time.  Is building solar panels dependent on the cost of energy or the cost of labor and does India have an advantage in these two area?  In some energy intensive industries, it may make sense to buy a lot of panels from China and use that electricity to power a solar panel factory.  The video just talks about tax cuts, tariffs free or low cost land. But more important is does the country have an inherent advantage in some way (eg lower labor cost).

But you should understand that they provide a lot of jobs in your country, although they live a rich and cool lifestyle, don&#39;t forget that they are contributing a lot to the nation ( a lot more than you and me). So start supporting Indian businessmen, rather than supporting foreign companies just because their CEO is Indian. Jay Hind üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥",

India though late but if speed up and  thinking differently  to make solar power and use materials available in india it can beat others.  What i see is india is following chines method.  This is not the way to win the match.  Come from behind win by strategy.  Where do India get raw material  while chaina has monopoly. why not India go to counties Africa  where raw materials are plenty and invest under lease.   Explore Indian raw material or change the current ingredients  for modules to construct solar panels. If gold is expensive use copper strategy. India has the capacity and capability  AT THE same time why chage attitute but does it has the mind.

1993,X-CLMLrHcqU,What will happen when china stops export of key raw material to India ?,
1994,X-CLMLrHcqU,Stupid! Why are you saying China trying to strangle the growth of India! Why don&#39;t India make in India! Shame!,
1995,X-CLMLrHcqU,China has 250GW manufacturing capacity. Concentrate on hydrogen as we will be on par with China. Doubt solar wafer manufacturing in India will work.,

After Britain shrewdly partitioned India and Pakistan into two different religious halves, you guys have been so pre-occupied going at each others throats - the train has already left the station. <br><br>China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore - all Asians just like you, our economies are galloping away whilst Indians cannot even design a competent and desirable car, much less a high speed train or a modern Air Plane.<br><br>I used to work as a Foreman in construction sites with lots of laborers from India. If there&#39;s one thing my Indian workers wish for - it is NOT to have an Indian Supervisor. <br><br>You see, Indian loathe their kind. <br><br>An Indian Sup have so little compassion for his workers toiling in the hot sun. Likewise, the Indian workers have so little respect for any instructions from their supervisor, if he is Indian. <br><br>Granted, I have seen horrible Chinese Supervisors, but the Indian workers dont seem to mind them so much. I am a Chinese.<br><br>To me, ALL my workers are a treasure. Even though I was earning a pittance ( in 1983 - $600 per month ! ), I would surreptitiously buy packets of drinks for them to counter the heat from the weather in Singapore. A little bit of care goes a long, long way. I could trust my workers to do at least a half-decent job ! No offence intended. More than once, my Indian workers saved my ass from dangers I did not anticipate. The Singapore dollar is so valuable for the workers to send home; they dare not spend it at the shops - even to buy their rice grains for cooking. And more than once, I&#39;ll put a 10Kg bag of rice on Company Tab at the Petrol Stations that has a grocery outlet and pass it to the head-worker. The look of gratitude in his eyes cannot be described. I am pretty sure, there is more than 1 Indian who has managed to buy a farm with his meagre salaries earned in Singapore - who has a good impression of Singapore - because of a young Chinese Foreman he met in Singapore.<br><br>In short, what I&#39;m trying to say is - no use moaning about what is wrong with your society. Give a little, share a little and your fellow man may start to cultivate the same with others. That way, we build a better tomorrow for our children. <br><br>Aircraft Carriers, Rocket Spaceships, Impressive Bullet Trains are good but love, care and considerate behaviour are much much more essential if we are to work at our best level. <br><br>And please tell your fellow Indians who post videos on Youtube or Internet; stop bashing China, or Pakistan, or Afghanistan, or whoever offends you. Winners go about quietly ponder solutions to make tomorrow better. <br><br>Only Losers - go round bad-mouthing others.    <br><br>When you respect and treat your own kind with fairness and kindness, USA, Britain or anybody will not dare to treat you with disdain - or as a lever.",

U could have covered that in brief...<br>2) Sweekar brand was great. But because of low profit margins, it was divested by Marico and sold to Cargill , u should have mentioned that...<br>3) The competition from Parachute oil was so tough for HUL that it had to finally sell its Nihar Shanti oil to Marico despite rebranding and relaunching it several times..<br>4) Continuing about Parachute oil, it was first a b2b business and the oil was sold in big cans, Harsh mariwala, realising the potential sold it in 100 ml packets <br>5) parachute oil when started to sell in square bottles, they were leaky and even caught mice. As a result, Marico developed them circular so that mice couldn&#39;t hold the bottle. They also kept a bottle in a rat cage so many days to validate it.....<br><br>That&#39;s all from my side, hope you address the fact....",

2231,-d7f71CFACo,"I think the consumers should keep both or more of these competitors competing so the economy flourishes. There are evidences of Reliance‚Äôs market strategy that they try to capture the market and then make profits when they are the monopoly. The same could be the strategy with Amazon or other competitors too, but, if one becomes a monopoly, the consumers will be the ones who suffer.",

I personally have felt duped by Reliance on not one but multiple times. On the other hand Amazon has never dissapointed even once. Unless Amazon closes shop in India , I for one dont see myself switching sides.",

2240,-d7f71CFACo,Amazon is always remain a xtian company to the core which carries a huge hatred towards every other culture on this planet including us,
2241,-d7f71CFACo,"Hahaha, in India if we cannot build India what is the point of being Indian, but then again after all the support to an Indian to be a businessman to be a tacoon cannot respect another Indian I say surse the day he was born and the life he lives till he can lift up India to be a human.",
2242,-d7f71CFACo,I prefer Amazon over Reliance any day.,
2243,-d7f71CFACo,All this because of modi govt policy<br>Who only wants ambani and adani <br>In every sector...,
2244,-d7f71CFACo,Reliance cannot compete with Amazon ever.,
2245,-d7f71CFACo,"Nice explained. Please do sector wise analysis like the healthcare sector, Service sector etc.",
2246,-d7f71CFACo,Though Reliance could beat Amazon in future but the trust and good will amazon has generated in 8 years of doing business in India is very hard for Reliance to break. And also amazon helps in buying of goods which are not available in India and for Reliance its tough to ship foreign products because he established retail chains only in India and Amazon has global level retail chain which gives a plus to amazon. The dominance of Amazon&#39;s is very hard to break at global level but considering reliance could be a good alternative for  purchasing domestic products.,
2247,-d7f71CFACo,Sorry to say this video is full of false information!,
2248,-d7f71CFACo,Even chroma is already beating amazon in electronics section. They have service centres which make them more trustworthy. And even chroma products are more value for money than amazon basic .,
2249,-d7f71CFACo,For nation goodness do not support reliance.,
2250,-d7f71CFACo,"Haha funny how India restricts Amazon and all foreign competitors from open competition, Reliance may have the ear of the politicians for a price?  However this is not how India becomes wealthy and successful. India must become highly focused with a sense of URGENCY like the Chinese or Japanese, see how India can do that, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9hvfLhH1jQ&amp;t=81s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9hvfLhH1jQ&amp;t=81s</a>",

2253,-d7f71CFACo,I do not shopping from Amazon beacuse they don&#39;t deliver product to my house but flipkart do.,
2254,-d7f71CFACo,The biggest point is Reliance has Indian politicians in his pocket whereas Amazon hasn&#39;t. Reliance is good at managing governments to make policies favourable to its own business. India must allow FDI and foreign companies to make its economy grow. Amazon is about customer getting benefitted but Reliance and other Indian companies are about their own profit. Take example of jio.. started cheap but now expensive.,
2255,-d7f71CFACo,Is India separated in tier category?,
2256,-d7f71CFACo,If new fdi rules are problem for Amazon then it will start a new company as indian company with help of Indians so they can do what reliance will do,
2257,-d7f71CFACo,Reliance gives free like tamil nadu govt and then make billions of money when they get their time,
2258,-d7f71CFACo,Why couldnt amazon involve indian postal service for return policy.. with this the govt also earns some money right!!,

2289,-d7f71CFACo,Amazon&#39;s customer service is nearly perfected and in company RIL looks like it&#39;s in it&#39;s infancy stage with very very slow expansion. But I still have more faith in RIL than Amazon for two major reasons : Indian Govt Policies and Advantage of RIL&#39;s strong foundation (aka the micro warehouses and decade of goodwill).,
2290,-d7f71CFACo,Now this video is outdated with cloudtail gone and replaced by Indian companies. Amazon is technically a marketplace now.,
2291,-d7f71CFACo,Reliance bribed Indian Govt. to restrict Amazon.  Though this decission is good for country. But Indian govt. Won&#39;t mind cz it would provide tonnes of tax,
2292,-d7f71CFACo,Whatever the logic maybe Amazon is extremely customer centric. As a loyal customer I&#39;m fully satisfied with Amazon India &amp; will stick to it as long as it&#39;s reliable (for me).,

2377,8rulgRgwHYc,"I don&#39;t get HOW Indians can still believe this crap?! Y&#39;all are gonna be so surprised how things turn out within a decade.<br>The foremost requirements for being a superpower is economic superiority which, today, comes from technology and innovation. India is a dud in both.<br>Those advocating that India is high tech better familiarise themselves with the current world tech scenarios in battery tech, additive manufacturing, BCIs, organic printing etc. These and many more are areas of which India is not even aware of, let alone have a presence.<br>Our tech is borrowed, we are not innovative, we don&#39;t give any manufactured product to the world. Made in India is NOT a mark of reliability in ANY manufactured product.<br>Despite being a nation of 1.4 billion people and having NO sizeable constraints, our level of industrialization is minimal &amp; we are becoming a service oriented economy...that too for internal consumption. Most of our start ups are in fintech &amp; designed for use in India only.<br>India can NEVER become a superpower. Not unless the Indian society changes and people start getting empathetic. This is the starting point to innovation &amp; growth. We develop empathy as a society, then, maybe in two or three generations, we can start talking about ruling the world.<br>Till then, such stupid talks are only lip service to our cognitive dissonance, which is there aplenty in all Indians, thanks to our overinflated egos.<br>What we don&#39;t realise is how precarious the situation is becoming. The West is aggressively moving towards automation in ALL areas. Which means heavy reduction in manual tasks, leading to lesser jobs. India can expect a lot of expats returning home within a decade.<br>The world&#39;s top soil is eroding. Post 2050, India will start losing its single biggest global advantage area of food production as better farming tech grows abroad.<br>India will be used by the world as a market only...like it&#39;s being used today. People will be paid highly for working in foreign owned companies that have set up shop in India. But despite having a high salary will live hand to mouth because everything will be very expensive.<br>The future of India is high unemployment, high crime &amp; govt controlled living. The time has almost run out. If something is not done to make India globally relevant in terms of economics by 2030, this country and its people are doomed.<br>But I don&#39;t see any attempt by anyone towards this direction.",

Ki kam kma lenge but ye log barbaad ho jaye. Youth leaving 5%-10% of them others are going down the path of hatred thus not focusing on learning any skill + violence and hate along with poor infrastructure led to company not considering  setup  in india. Also the issue of brain drain which at some point of time was a great matter of concern is being neglected today when this issue is very dominant. Most of the highly talented person the top 1 percent of the 1 percent actually leave this country and contribute to economy of foreign nation. India being a superpower was a reality that could have been achieved if our country had the same pace and perception when this was a main issue but for now it&#39;s far from reality and if what&#39;s happening -the most concerning issue of division and hate propaganda is not stopped this dream would remain a dream .",

2550,8tBuAM0XHmY,But currently kerala state govt is struggling financially. The vision and dedication showed by the govt 20-25 years back was not taken over properly for sustainable development by the governments that followed. People are tax drained in every way possible. This will surely affect tourism here. Youth in kerala are leaving abroad. Soon kerala will be &quot;Olds own country&quot;.<br><br>- keralite.,

2563,8tBuAM0XHmY,One thing I like to improve in Kerala is roadway. It takes 5-6hours to reach 150kms without traffic. Roads are good but most of them are 2 lanes only. If Kerala build high speed railways between important cities then it will be game changer,
2564,8tBuAM0XHmY,Shall I remind you something irrespective of culture/ religion... let the tourists wear what ever they want don&#39;t stare...  and keep smiling because they contribute more than your millionaires,

2701,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Banks are a big jokers work with out application of mind. These loans are sanctioned by the board duly signed by work men Director, officers directors, RBI representative, all the<br>GM,ED and Chairman of the banks. These people should be held responsible for such risky loans. Now the bankers cry for increase in wages. <br>How could a bank sanction a loan when its Current liability exceeds Current asset? What were the Auditors doing  ? Is kam me hum sab .....hai ?<br>These are the same banks which refused loan to Infosys in the intial years and it was Karnataka State Finance Corporation .",
2702,vgV9HNuUxKY,S sir.<br>But they will delay and even kill person for money.<br>For rupee they will collect three rupees,

2707,vgV9HNuUxKY,Why can&#39;t they seize the promoter assets and the assets owned by the shell companies ?,
2708,vgV9HNuUxKY,"A small feedback. Though i enjoy your streams, i felt very little time was spent on the actual scam details. 22000 crores couldn&#39;t have been spent just on cars, real estate, etc right. It was a functioning shilp building company with 3000+ CR of inventory, why couldn&#39;t they execute the orders of SCI, IN &amp; CG? Why did the revenue start shrinking YoY? . Also please bring out who bears the cost of the list money. Provisioning will not make the loss go away right. Little disappointed. Hope to see better",
2709,vgV9HNuUxKY,Next will be our adani .... u can pull him out if  u r not a BJP bhakth.,

2712,vgV9HNuUxKY,Good information. Thank you,
2713,vgV9HNuUxKY,Government knows these frauds are there and coming. The question is why don&#39;t Government intervene and nip the bud...there is no interest for anyone in India. These things come out to lime light if and only if someone is not satisfied with the kickbacks,

2716,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Followed everything until Shell Companies were mentioned. Money laundering is converting untaxed money into bankable money. So in this case did ABG used Shell Companies to show it had other investors? So the fraud diversion of money? Also what is the state of ABG corporation? Who are the principal share holder, besides lenders.",
2717,vgV9HNuUxKY,i‚Äôm curious why finance minister pic is used ?,
2718,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Biggest bank fraud savers are BJP,banks looted by Adani through Modi,recently 12,600/ crores debts write off to adani he is Asia number one Billianaire so think your self who is main culprit.",

2720,vgV9HNuUxKY,This people should be locked for their natural life and sized all their assets,
2721,vgV9HNuUxKY,Ask Nirmala minister,
2722,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Moot question is why did the banks lent the money and on whose request? If a layman can see that the  balance sheet numbers were not good , does the lending reveal a hand in glove of the banks with the promoters? If the majority of the loan was given after 2014 then does this not classify as a corruption case for modi govt.? Why did the CBI take so long to file a case? Any links to the political class and their donations? No answers right. Where is the ED in this case?<br>Finally when the banks make a provision for this bad loans , is it not unfair on the shareholders of the banks as this leads to less profits for them. Imagine the share price and the amount of dividend that the shareholders could have earned on this money? The persons who sanctioned the loans need to be sacked and investigated.<br>Dont you agree",
2723,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Like cancer, which starts in tiny mm. Cells reaches a diagnosed Tu or,  after w raised to 32, Tumour.",
2724,vgV9HNuUxKY,"The main reason for bank loan failure is only the diversion of funds. But our laws instead of crippling such activities, protects them. Every ruling party has its own pockets of influence and their supporters to be protected. Hence laws are made to suit the convenience of the party in power.",

2729,vgV9HNuUxKY,Vo sab to theek hai...ye batao ki thumbnail me aunty ki photo kyo use ki üòÄ,
2730,vgV9HNuUxKY,The bankers have slept. 1. They should have continuous watch on Current Assets 2. They should view the portion of finished goods in current assets periodically. 3. Annual turnover should have been watched instead of order book before sanctioning loans. 4. A detailed probe on the bankers who have sanctioned loans is essential. 5. Collusion aspect? 6. Bankers may say no shock on their Balance sheet due to provision of NPA but what about loss on account of NPA?,
2731,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Nirmal garu, <br>I have trusted  state bank of india, after my retirement  the bank manager advised me  good returns will come  you invest in <a href=""http://sbi.mr/"">SBI.Mr</a> Sahu he lured me and invested Rs 60000,after 10years they gave me Rs 37000,they have described in the form  3lakhs",

2736,vgV9HNuUxKY,Private banks never take higher share in lending. But they control the cash flow which is the pulse of the account. Major lenders reluctance to learn,

2750,vgV9HNuUxKY,Lalit modi how much,
2751,vgV9HNuUxKY,My question is INDIA is scammer country that why no country wants to invest.,
2752,vgV9HNuUxKY,The owner pays 5 crore to 10 crore as salaries to Directors and main administration persons.<br>Company should pay 13% interest. If loan is 20000 crore interest will be 2600 crores. Tha salaries plus interest will become 25% so unless they get 30% profit they won&#39;t survive,
2753,vgV9HNuUxKY,"Your question on how all these fraudsters pull off these MASSIVE scams? The answer is greedy Politicians who introduce these fraudsters to the CEO&#39;s and Top committee members of these big banks. In return the fraudsters have to give a percentage of the stolen funds to both the Politician as well as the Bankers who helped in yhe scam. Yes when the ED &amp; CBI come they will majority of the time go after the fraudsters only not the Politicians or the greedy Bank bosses. The fraudsters take all the blame while the Politicians and Bankers who are just as guilty get away with the crime. Just look at Modi, Mallya, Wadhawan brothers and others.",

2937,8352JG8CCoE,"<b>History repeating like during WW2 and WW1/Spanish plague.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now under WW3 and a corona virus pandemic. Hitler used Zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the fumant removed.  It causes symptoms like corona virus.  Look up in the sky you will see planes spraying your cities!  Hitler attacked Russia, just like what is happening now.  The British Empire had no legal male Heir so they imported a fake one from Germany.  The British Queen&#39;s husband &quot;Prince Philip&quot; renounced his German citizenship, became a Greek citizen and as a Greek citizen moved to Britain gaining citizenship there.  After gaining citizenship, he was appointed a Duke, out of thin air and then as a Prince and married Queen Elizabeth.  &quot;Prince Philip&quot; took the name of the Queen, not the other way, as it usually is done, where a wife takes the husband&#39;s name.  The British Empire has run out of male Heirs at least twice, and they kill to suppress it.    WW2 was a way of hiding this fraud, and now WW3 is a way of hiding that illegal combines Heir. The Bible says that a male would not fail to sit on the throne.  A family name continues through the males, not the females, and Philip was a fraud.  He had become a Greek citizen to make it appear that he was a Royal from the earlier Greek dynasty.</b>  Total theater.  <b>The Catholic Empires of the Roman Empire form one leg and the UK(British controlled) Empire forms the other leg of the Roman Empire, with the King Pope Francis as the ruler of the whole system.  He has a triple teired crown with 666 on it in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  He is a King of the city state of the Vatican(the Vatican is the smallest Country in the world), Rome Italy, and is mentioned in Revelation, Apocalypse, 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions that this Empire is responsible for all those slaughtered on earth.  It mention what the leaders wear, which is scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  The UK leg Royals also wear those colors, a long with Judges and Magistrates of the Crown.  They refer to this entity as the Crown.  When some one goes to court in one of the British subservient Nations, it is said that the Crown has a case against the person.</b>  Canada, Australian and others are not sovereign or free.  please read Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, and study it closely, because this Empire comes as a false system claiming to represent God, but exterminates to stay in power.  <b>1Timothy3:1-16 mentions that the one looking after a group(Church) should be a husband of one wife with obedient children.  The Pope and the Priests of the Catholic Church are forbidden to marry, and so don&#39;t even qualify, according to the very book and God they say they claim to represent(an unmarried man has no wife or children.)   The Bible&#39;s Peter&#39;s mother in-law was cured by Jesus(Yeshua).  So if Peter had a mother in law, then he had a wife as there is no other way.</b>  That is why Catholic Priest have sex with so many little boys, girls and women attendees.  <b>There was over ninety cases of Preists molesting little boys in the city of Boston, USA alone.  None of the Priests were disciplined, but were only moved to a different location, and now you know why.  The whole system is a fraud.</b>  So this organization has many false teachings.  <b>The Roman Emporer forced a combining of Biblical and Pagan beliefs, when Rome Nationalized the Church.  Rome forbid the celebration of Biblical Holy days and Sabbaths under threat of beatings, then confiscation of property and finally death.   Many beheaded or burned alive.</b>  Revelation Apocalypse 18:4 says get out of this organization &quot;my people&quot; if you don&#39;t want to receive her plagues.  <b>Freedom to communicate is under attack by Church and State, up to the point they are threatening to bomb the microprocessor production facilities.</b>  Pray for me and you, please!  <b>Russia says they have the proof that Britain was involved in at least thres major terror attacks against Russia.</b>  Would Russia bomb their own 5+ Billion pipeline, their own bridge, powerplants and Navel yards?  <b>NATO said that they would attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize their island, because Australia would feel threatened, but NATO was militarizing Ukraine, where they had bunkers full of weapons.  NATO&#39;s puppet regime in Ukraine was banning the Russian language and culture even though that was many people&#39;s only language.  The Ukrainian Capital is a Russian word until Western media changed it to hide the Russian history, as Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a recent NATO coup, which the US planned, as they told their dignitaries not to attend the Russian Olympics at that time. You could go to prison for teaching the Russian language. All opposition parties in Ukraine (banned).  Those with out blue arm bands(now yellow?) being put to death.</b>  Many US Officials had been talking about a coming war with Russia and China.  Years in advance.  <b>Donald J Trump said he couldn&#39;t answer corona virus questions claiming we are at war.</b>  Trump said that the US will soon be at war with Russia and China. <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, but are part of China, as acknowledged by most nations of the world till recently.</b>  NATO is planning to do to Taiwan and China what they did to Ukraine and Russia.  <b>Britain fighting for Democracy in Ukraine?  Britain has had two or three Prime Ministers that have not been ellected, trying to help the naked Emporer.</b>  Think!  <b>Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband&#39;s attack is a fraud.  The Police changed and contradicted the events multiple times and it makes no sense.</b>  Corona virus is a code name for information that exposes the crown(Government/Royals).  A vaccine is computer/electronic device program that deletes information from your view(anti virus software).  Symptoms for a biological virus comes from being gased, radiated or sprayed in your environment.  <b>Planes fly in parallel patterns, causing heating of your environment and breathing difficulties.  Like Hitler killed by Zyklon B gas, so now they use a deadly gas in incubators.</b>  Donald J Trump said he would put Hilary R Clinton in prison when ellected for starting a war and genocide in Libya, but when he got in power did nothing.  Americans have started many unjust wars.  <b>America/NATO is about to start wars with Ethiopia, Haiti, Taiwan, Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the list goes on.  NATO Countries have invaded more than half of all sovereign Nations on earth, in the last 30 years.</b>  When you print money on paper and then go buy things with it, and it is not backed by any thing then you have to attack a lot of people to keep the scheme going.  <b>New Central Bank digital currencies(CBDCs) will be centralized and backed only by cow farts and trust, where as Bitcoin is decentralized and backed by gold.  Bitcoin/gold and silver came under a major attack by the crown(governments).  The digital currencies will create a M.O.B. type system, that if you get in government cross hairs you will be shut out of the system just like Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Russia and so on and so on.  If they do it to a complete Country, then they will have no problem doing it to individuals.  Canada confiscated people&#39;s money breaking international law.</b>  Rome enters a Country, exterminates, and keeps the remaining people&#39;s in refugee camps called Reserves.  Periodically they thin out the population.  They usually make a lot of noise about sport team names with Native names and how people are trying to erase their names, so as to hide the real erasure of actual peoples.  <b>Revelation 7:9, God says he would take out of all Nations and Tribes and Peoples a people for himself.  God accepts all those who accept him of all Nationalities.</b>  Donald J Trump started operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American people by military nurses.  Trump added death by electrocution, firing squad, poison gas to the already used lethal injection.   <b>Trump foretold war on Russia and China years in advance, a said no one would protect the Pope more than him.</b>  America turned it&#39;s back on God, so now he is turning his back on you.  <b>The US, Canada, Germany, Italy, Britain, Australia, Austria, Ukraine and many other Nations refused to agree and voted against a move at the United Nations to condemn Nazism.  Russia voted against Nazism.  Remember the Nazis?  They started WW2 and exterminated 12000000 human beings, often by extremely cruel means.  The Ukraine military has a entire Nazi battalion the Azov Nazi battalion.  Church leaders clearly seen in Hitler&#39;s Nazi SS footage blessing the troops before slaughters.  The Azov Steel Works was full of Nazis that surrendered to Russia, with pictures confirming their Nazi swastikas tattooed on their bodies.</b>  Ukraine banned all opposition parties and is trying to exterminate the Russian language, people and culture.

That said, every country has a right to protect its waterways and byways, whether they are economic or just plain physical conveyance. Besides, unlike the US, China does not just just offer aid, they actually went and built needed infrastructure for the ROW - rest of the world. This has been a habit since the 1970s - albeit with Communist friends first. Or &quot;comrades in arms&quot;. That Chinese citizens died doing such arduous tasks willingly speaks much of the egality and altruism mindset Communist doctrine does promote. (Think China massive poverty alleviation success not long ago.)<br><br>Taking an US vs THEM mentality only promotes unhealthy nationalism, aka fascism and pales the chance for dialog and cooperative effort. With China, it is always good to cooperate for a win-win situation.

3018,KNblG_-QOL0,"Way back in nineteenth century Swami Vivekanand was confronted with a question. The question was:You talk so much about India&#39;s rise as a great civilisation,but you never talk about freedom from foreign rule. Why? The monk had answered:What will you do with your freedom?First build your character. Then ask for freedom. The politicians  of his days didn&#39;t  listen to his advice and that&#39;s why India is a mess today. But it seems LKY somehow figured it out and applied it by ordering conscription of youth above 18 years  age. He begged the British not to leave and build up the national army and with it the national character. That was the first block on which the foundation of the nation rests.Chinese people(not Communist variety)  have enormous prudence and entrepreneurship. Look at how wonderful Taiwan is! That came handy while raising Singapore from the scratch. In India the early post Independence leadership  thought they were great in their own right and everything was at their beck and call. They thought by granting universal franchise they were building a great nation unified by a national dream while in reality they were building a feudal state. The people had to pay a heavy price because an Indian version of LKY was lacking.Perhaps Subhash Bose  would have been the Indian LKY. But  u never know.<br>2.  While giving all the credit to Singapore for her glitter and dazzle,one must not forget India is an altogether a different ball game. Singapore was part of British Malay but its Chinese majority decided to separate and like muslims in British India demanded seperation. British was as generous as it was in case of British India. Thats how like Pakistan,Singapore came into existence. While Pakistanis squandered their opportunity in building up a multi ethnic society using her excellent geostrategic position Singapore cleverly avoided all that went wrong with Pakistan.The result is there for everyone to see. Pakistan has lost half of its territory and lives in hostile environment with a fragile economy Singapore dazzles.There is a great lesson here. Set your priorities right. Otherwise perish! Unlike Singapore India is enormously bulky. So any decay is slow, any rise is equally slow. India can not produce quick results like Singapore. But post2014 the NASA picture of night time India show it has started glowing emerging from darkness almost equally as Europe does. It is pretty good,especially considering that India doesn&#39;t  use public flogging to bring the errant civilians to heels.<br>.",

Indians think world is a country and Countries are like state, Same can be seen inside as well",
3037,KNblG_-QOL0,In my opinion it is pointless to compare a city state like Singapore with a sub-continental sized country like India because large size creates its own problems. This is true not only of countries but units within countries. Can you meaningfully compare Chandigarh or Goa with Uttar Pradesh or West Bengal?,

So far, we are yet to have one in that aspect. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the will power, vision and mandate to bring in sweeping reforms in basic governance.  South Korea and Japan are the OTHER TWO great examples we the Indians should learn from. They faced brtual wars and its consequences, yet they emerged so fast as well-developed technology superpowers. 7 decades have passed since India&#39;s independence, still our institutions and policies are evolving around a decayed foundation that has the unfortunate legacy of British raj! The British raj has left lasting impression on our politicians and institutions. They are yet to fully come out of that mentality. No country will ever make meaningfull progress without dignifying its own citizens and it can be achieved only through systemic reforms in governance. India&#39;s politics and bureaucracy whether it is central or states are yet to evolve to become one that of Singapore or Japan. In simplistic terms, there is performance measurement and accountability in every aspect of a private sector job, if you don&#39;t perform above the standard baseline then your job is gone but India&#39;s bureaucratic/administrative system devoid of such stringent accountability and any meaningful evolution because there is an unwritten rule of mutual privilege both the political class and the public sector (Sarkari class) enjoy for so many decades since independence. They get paid, their job is secured, they get pension and entitlements, their job is well protected by layers of rules irrespective of how they perform or what they do at the cost of tax-payers and common man. It is not a sweeping statement but a reality happening in-front of our eyes. If Hon&#39;ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi can focus on this crucial aspect then only India can reach greater heights.",

3282,vkrBQCQLQG0,Great info,
3283,vkrBQCQLQG0,"Everyone in the comments thinks that by watching this video they have gained knowledge of the video game industry. BUT THIS VIDEO HAS A LOT OF MISINFORMATION AND HE HAS CHOSEN TO IGNORE A LOT OF DATA. Let me break it down :<br>1) He says that console &amp; PC has very less accessibility and very limited market. That is completely false. Consoles are used in 250M households around the world which is more than amount of households that have Netflix(200M) . More than 3 Billion people play video games today. That is more than half of the connected world. 2 billion of those play on mobile. 1 billion play on console and PC. How can you call a market with 1 billion consumers limited? And in 2 Billion mobile market, 1 billion are from India( around 400-450M players) and third world countries where console and PC penetration is low. Approximately less than 1 billion who play mobile are in areas where console &amp; PC penetration is moderate to high like US, UK, Europe and the west. Even though there are 1 billion gamers in those areas, there are actual statistics that show that those people spend more on console &amp; PC than in mobile. One of The biggest fallacy in this video is that he calls $100B top-line business &quot;limited market&quot;. He says that $300-400 consoles are barriers to entry while ignoring that on average people in New York spend $300 PER WEEK ON Groceries. People in the west spend thousands of dollars on phones and you call consoles expensive? Consoles are only expensive in countries like India, Brazil, Africa etc.. because of low income and high import taxes, not surprising because only 5% percent of mobiles sold in India are more than ‚Çπ40,000($550). Consoles are inexpensive devices in the west and that&#39;s why almost every household has a console or a PC and why in countries like India you don&#39;t find a console or a PC in any of the households.",

Even today this Market orders comes with slippages but they are discounted while the model is being created Or the other hand Limit orders comes into play with almost negligible to 0 slippage if you want that level of precision (which again are sent to Exchange pre-hand so again incoming data lag doesn&#39;t matter). For Hedge Funds to reduce latency, they&#39;d be in Colocation already (Also that much slippages you mentioned in video are nothing as they itself buy in many Legs across various periods). Long short that lag practically made 0 impact from investors perspective as that level of precision in market Orders didn&#39;t mattered.

3551,TqZRgHOlKmU,"These are few reasons... there are other things as well.  <br>If there is a jury,  a group of people to arrive at an unanimous decision,  you might get rejected there,  because of their mood / difference of opinion. <br>The best thing is to run through the whole scenario of what has happened and analyse after every rejection,  you will figure out yourself. What you believe to be true is the truth,  trust your instincts.<br>If everything you did was perfect, may be what you values and what the organization values are oppsites,  then also you will be rejected. <br>If you are rejected,  it&#39;s better you look for another workplace,  why because sooner or later,  either you or the organization will realize something nonsyncing,  meanwhile you worked there and wasted your time,  seeing yourself going not too far.  <br>Another one is about the workspace,  domination in terms of ethnicity,  culture, philosophy, ethnics,  company policy matters, general practices they follow,  that is not easy going with you.  In simple words POLITICS WITHIN.<br><br>My advice,  after every rejection,  is to aanalyze it and jump back on your toe quickly,  all dressed and prepared enough to give another interview.  <br>Failure / rejection is your responsibility to an extent,  but not all of yours.  <br>Don&#39;t worry!  Experience the thrill of it, taste the bitterness,  sweetness,  truthiness and flirt with it like you would do to your crush. ENJOY IT!<br>You surely will lack such experience for long intervals: as we are used to switching jobs less frequently.<br><br>It&#39;s 100% Natural to feel intimidated. <br>The job searching process itself makes anyone feel smaller,  weeker and it happens within everyone.<br><br> TRUST YOURSELF,  WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS THE TRUTH,  those who hire people can be manipulative sometimes, they can  do so to sign you in for a lesser salary than what you actually deserve. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN INTEREST TOO.<br><br>ü§ûü§ò",

3612,JqSeQ3c4_qI,"MDH commercials are note worthy. The story is truly Indian and as simple as giving a masala powder in a packet has such groundwork based on it. <br>We all know Aachi, Everest etc.,  but MDH and the sincerity that goes with it is memorable. <br>The investment behind quality supplies is enormous. Outsourcing in food is a recipe for disaster. <br>We got a legend and in today&#39;s startup culture shall we see his spirit again in the products we use is a question. <br>Still I appreciate your effort in bringing the story behind a true Indian.

3706,yhpVAki47RI,Ultimately the users were benefited and even now the cheapest internet is in India.<br>I remember those days when my dad used data just for his work<br>and playing videos was so expensive that we were watching it at the end of month when the pack was about to expire. <br>Jio truly brought a revolution from paying same amount per gigabyte to per day a gigabyte. <br>I don&#39;t think our country would have digitalized to this extent without that revolution. <br>Internet is the new era and data is the fuel to access it.<br>I don&#39;t think majority of our country&#39;s population would have been able to use internet and the smartphone market wouldn&#39;t have seen such a growth. <br>It destroyed the buildings to built the skyscrapers.,
3707,yhpVAki47RI,"Ambani&#39;s are always Ambani&#39;s No one can beat them in customer inclusion. Still, remember how reliance phones gave free night talk time during 2009 by making a revolution by providing 2000 rs. handsets to all hands of Indian citizens, then again with Jio they help to digitalize the whole nation within a quarter of a year which no govt. can imagine for its people till that time. They are business minded but their business itself a revolution in each and every field for enriching a common man by all means. We lost Anil Ambani sir but still waiting for his resurgence to the nation&#39;s wellness.

3710,yhpVAki47RI,I do agree that Internet services became cheaper for some time due to Jio but at the same time Calling services became worst due to Jio.<br>Jio trying to establish the monopoly but failed to provide the better calling facilities to the users and it&#39;s because they failed to handle crores of users.<br><br>Note: No single telecom company Can dominate the Indian market because almost every indian is using a cell phone right now and its impossible for the userbase of any company to handle such a huge amount of users.,

3712,yhpVAki47RI,"jio gave 6 months free subscription to their customers. All outgoing calls free, Unlimited datas free and all. Its just to gain customer from Airtel, TATA DOCOMO, Idea, VI, BSNL and Aircel. Because of this action done by jio the other telecom companies such as Aircel, TATA docomo Idea they could not withstand. They merged with other big companies and Aircel company closed. If the free subscription was not given no customers will go to jio. I dont like the way jio came top. am using BSNL &amp; Airtel for past 11 years.",

3715,yhpVAki47RI,"I am using Airtel sim only due to its better coverage and fast internet. In my area jio is lagging in it&#39;s fast internet service and it is persisting since a long time now. I dont know why jio is not focusing in providing high speed internet and better coverage. I work from home and airtel internet just work fine without any lag.<br>Having said that I always have a jio sim with me. If their internet service will improve, I will readily switch from airtel to jio. They also do not cost any money to keep sim active without recharge. Their plans are also cheaper than airtel. I have been a fan of jio and I admire the revolution it has brought in form of digitalizing india.",
3716,yhpVAki47RI,Reliance Adani business should not be part of business studies lessons.  Reliance Adani  Modi govt waive all loans and handed over profitable business at throw away price.  All Psu banks part any money two fellows .,

3728,yhpVAki47RI,"Loved the video but to be honest and in my opinion, Airtel survived from the looted money from the customers which it got by randomly activating VAS services on customers&#39; accounts and charging a premium amount to rack millions unless the customer goes to their customer support centers and deactivated it. Many gullible and innocent people never even knew that this kind of service had been activated on their SIM. <br><br>I like the idea of phone recharge vouchers which are available now where customers pay some advance sum and get the service and nothing else can be activated by these fraudsters (Airtel in this case)<br><br>Edit: Looking at the comments made by other people I can totally see how this issue resonates everywhere when it comes to Airtel. They definitely have looted millions of innocent people for no reason.<br><br>But I would totally agree that Airel&#39;s network is one of the best in, especially when it comes to remote areas.",

3732,yhpVAki47RI,"Ok, the other thing is Jio installing fiber cables which is taking time to cater to all the areas... and as you said Airtel using local existing vendor. This is one of the reason people using Airtel for now but they will jump to jio fiber connection the moment it&#39;s available in the missing areas.<br>Jio has better ott options, bandwidth and speed without interruptions.

3741,yhpVAki47RI,"Jio&#39;s ecosystem will always be bigger then Airtel&#39;s. And Jio made internet to be a common man&#39;s luxury. Rest since both are Indian companies so I want both of them to thrive n get outsider companies, (thriving in various other sectors) to go from here like farming, toys, Mobile phones etc. We have lot to reclaim so both the Indian giants should flourish exponentially",

3748,yhpVAki47RI,Jio  net sucks,
3749,yhpVAki47RI,"I still think Jio brought a great revolution in the intranet service.  The place where I live in India , it is 60 kilometer away from Chennai.  I tried thru Airtel several times, but every occasion they were saying still the facility didn‚Äôt come to my place.  Whereas , a couple of years ago, I bought Jio wireless router and subscribe data plan 3 gb one day.  Which was phenomenal !  Whenever I come to India after  Jio,connection, i felt like I was connected to the world.  Also, it has been helping me to work from my native to US office during my travel in India.  All these happened by Jio.  Airtel might be good in other places, but not in my place.",
3750,yhpVAki47RI,"Although ,you are Bitching about the Most Genuine Player Jio ,we all should never forget that Airtel is looting us for packages like 1GB/299 and deducting 100s of talk time amount after data consumed of 1 GB.<br>Also, Money Control is  sponsor for this video.

3787,yhpVAki47RI,i wish airtel would not have survived as well it has the worst network and poor costumer services just promising advertisement are gr8,
3788,yhpVAki47RI,I think i am choosing Airtel only because of its high speed that is the first and last reason and when jio lauch i choose it because of its less price even today jio has less price and Airtel has more speed but i choose idea because in my area it&#39;s speed is high and it is soo cheap and give free internet as well..üòÇüòÇ,
3789,yhpVAki47RI,jIo destroyed others.that was gud.,

3791,yhpVAki47RI,It&#39;s at the best interest of consumers to have all the 4 telecom players to be strong. Airtel &amp; Jio have been successful to have a good clout in the market<br>Despite huge debts &amp; AGR issue VI is continuing to provide service(which personally gave a pessimistic experience) <br>Government can resurrect BSNL to it&#39;s golden era of strength &amp; service standards by influx of Serious long-term investment(but i doubt it may happen),
3792,yhpVAki47RI,"So, the broadband actually saved the Airtel conglomerate",
3793,yhpVAki47RI,I don&#39;t think jio purposefully wants Airtel to stay in the market to avoid monopoly,
3794,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel didn&#39;t survive or beat Jio but got a kick up its back to get realistic in its price and quality thanks to Jio and simple economics of demand &amp; supply.,
3795,yhpVAki47RI,Kudos to you man üòÖ<br>Made an Airtel over Jio case study and got it sponsored by Moneycontrol (also owned by Reliance) üòÇüòÇ This makes me love the Internet even more.<br>Such good content should never stopüòÉ,

You never feel left out and brand recall is good. <br>That&#39;s why Amazon is doing well as it reaches home where family members recollect the experience. <br>For lessons,  to out against the best in the industry is tough as you need the support system. <br>In India any founder need the govt to support his enterprise.

3977,tI9fRLNmNkY,"One thing about Dell is eventually they were able to undercut the builders (myself being one of them back in the days). I used to build much better custom systems for my customers at less cost but once Dell got the costs down to where it was no longer profitable to &#39;build them&#39;, I started buying Dell&#39;s for my customers (albeit inferior to the systems I had been building in the past). There was a hitch as those low cost Dells we&#39;re hardly upgradable and cut corners with some &#39;mickey mouse&#39; stuff which meant they had a reduced usable lifetime (aka: disposable computers). Not bad for my business but not good for customers as they tended to hold on to those systems way beyond that &#39;stunted&#39; useful lifetime.<br><br>Generally, I don&#39;t buy Dells for myself (personal systems). However, they were ahead of the game on supporting Linux on their server lines which made them the &#39;go to&#39; for servers running linux and Dell has good support for Linux. However, this is changing and this &#39;niche&#39; is eroding. Like IBM, Dell is a company I suspect is a fading &#39;giant&#39; and really Lenovo has the edge. IBM is remaking itself and Dell will have to do the same before it&#39;s too late. <br><br>Ironically, much of the &#39;on-site&#39; support in the 90&#39;s I got from Dell were outsourced to IBM service people. I suspect Dell will need to get off the x86 processor monopoly or their fate will be tied to failing to diversify and will be undercut by less expensive ARM and possibly RISC-V power efficient alternatives. Dell is too tied to MS Windows and even MS has embraced Linux as Azure is their &#39;cash cow&#39; now and lumbering into ARM and we&#39;re getting to the point that the Linux desktop for the masses it&#39;s mature and the Windows monopoly will become a problem for this hardware company. Note: Dell does sell Laptops with Linux preinstalled but on the high end.... despite Linux usually entering in the recycle end (aka: EOL systems where Windows can&#39;t be upgraded and still be a useable system). This is a problem as Dell&#39;s desktops often die after the first 4 years (aka: disposable systems) and use cost cutting &#39;junk parts&#39; that have no long time support. AKA: not good for small businesses or countries looking to &#39;move away&#39; from the MS monopoly and reduce costs without losing productivity.",

3995,tI9fRLNmNkY,"One correction,  the statement of IBM don&#39;t own is misleading. I studied IBM PCs and clones for a year, and It was IBM who brought architecture of segregating Memory (ram), processor and internal and external drives for memory and made the architecture Free for all as a service to computer industry.  <br>Also when companies had policy of take all profits by making all by themselves, IBM had strict policy like SAP and few other companies of partnerships and growing together. they chose this route deliberately to see world as we see today. the bus to connect hardware, 8bit and 16 bit memory address were all ibms design. IBM still own the design and architecture we use today and allowed all to use and compete with IBM without issue. <br><br>IBM was the one who invented computer in first place and without them none of these technologies even existed. Also, IBM designed personal computers and helped computer industry thrive...so saying IBM failed and Dell did better than IBM and hence Dell better than IBM  is completely misleading. Even today Dell uses IBM architecture and has not invented new architecture. IBM  helped industry thrive and clones such as Dell and hp and acer and all other companies make money and boast about it..",

4106,dVtnSPZn6BU,Great,
4107,dVtnSPZn6BU,"As son of a successful LIC agent, I have heard many discussion between an agent with the client. And it is my strongest view that LIC has been successful simply because it was seen as a government (backed) organization. There was times in 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s where many investment companies would open up and siphon off people&#39;s money. Hence there was a trust on government backed LIC that helped agents to convince customers that their money was safe. I agree some of the other comments below that some lic branch officers were rude and behaved like any other government officer. But for common public, the safety of money was of utmost importance that helped LIC a lot.",

In foreign countries people took an appointment of insurance officer to take an insurance... Now people don&#39;t have faith in the term insurance that&#39;s why they don&#39;t take it. I can confirm that in India 80% don&#39;t have insurance....,
4170,dVtnSPZn6BU,LIC is one of the most inefficient organization.. just check online premium and compare it with private players..LIC is a mechanism for government to milk any time..Most of the Failed OFS of PSUs were bailed by LIC...Mis selling is synonymous with LIC agents..sorry Ganesh not happy with glorifying such pathetic  organization,

4193,dVtnSPZn6BU,They can have a zoom call with LIC agent in Covid times. Its completely wrong to think people would go on to websites and purchase insurance in matter of 5 minutes. Insurance is still a costly affair and personal relationship with a agent gives us that secure feeling from inside who has been operating as an agent in our hyperlocal region for decades and have built relationship with our neighbours. Trust is a big factor for LIC. TATA brand is built on Trust and we know how the business is doing.,

Isn&#39;t the decoy price of 5 dollar difference rom the premium commodity understandable for any customers who think in marketing way? While those who don&#39;t think that way are surely not premium customers and they go for lower price commodity.<br><br>2. Well this one is for you... Well what you describe through these videos are marketing strategies which IKEA or any companies don&#39;t want to reveal. Don&#39;t they react against you by exposing their ideas even though they are academic studies, which might effect their business?",

4353,glHQPkrcf8A,"I have been following IKEA for over 2 decades and I have never found the &#39;decoy&#39; pricing methodology in practice in any part of the world. Also IKEA has been studying the Indian market for nearly a decade before committing itself to enter the Indian mkt. As an architect, we have learnt the hard way the decoy effect of proposing designs in a known gradation of quality. We deliberately show a bad/insufficient design along with a probable good design such the Client recognises shortfalls of the inadequate design and appreciates the fulfillment of the those deficiencies in the &#39;better&#39; design - where the entire thing is orchestrated.",

4375,glHQPkrcf8A,Decoy effect wow,
4376,glHQPkrcf8A,For India their prices are high for Chinese furniture,
4377,glHQPkrcf8A,This video is gonna come up everytime ikea opens a new store in India üòÇ,
4378,glHQPkrcf8A,People after attending &quot; Master class&quot; will do business strategy video of &quot; Think school&quot; üòÅ,
4379,glHQPkrcf8A,So if everyone buy 40 dollar and 65 dollar product the decoy product will be waste right?,
4380,glHQPkrcf8A,Dan lok told this strategy a long time ago,
4381,glHQPkrcf8A,"Think School has an eye for beautiful girls, nice marketing strategy for the Indian men :P",
4382,glHQPkrcf8A,I will go for Magnum üòÅüòÅ,
4383,glHQPkrcf8A,"Won&#39;t $60 shelf will increase the dead inventory as most of the customers who can spend on premium product will buy $65 shelf<br>.<br>.<br>Or IKEA will produce $60 shelf in minimal qty,  just for purpose of displaying it",
4384,glHQPkrcf8A,Pleaee make vedio on ZARA fashion brand,
4385,glHQPkrcf8A,"I am sorry but the decoy pricing method that you share in this video (while the science of it makes sense and is applicable) is not a good explanation of why IKEA is so successful. <br><br>The absolutely main reason for their success is brilliant design for the price they charge. Period. <br><br>In addition to this, minimalistic design, creative functionality, retail store design, amazing packaging and outstanding DIY implementation also add to their success.<br><br>For a example, try and find - in India - a carpenter-made TV cabinet for the same design and price that IKEA will sell you. <br><br>It‚Äôs (almost) not possible. <br><br>Their sales are amazing because they get it right on so many levels (yes, including the cultural sensitivity of their target markets), not just pricing. Their retail store design is marketing genius. It makes you go through the store in a way that exponentially increases your chances to buy on a whim or impulse.<br><br>Form + function + reasonable prices. That‚Äôs why they sell truck loads of their products.",
4386,glHQPkrcf8A,Really appreciate your hardwork bro. More power to youüëç,

4388,glHQPkrcf8A,Well explained the Decoy theory effect.....good analysis too,
4389,glHQPkrcf8A,Why you can&#39;t become to entrepreneur?,
4390,glHQPkrcf8A,To whomever reading this here is a little pun... If you see the laptop section in the description you can see that it directs to think pad since it&#39;s suggested by think school üòÉüòÄüòÇ I know it&#39;s not that funny,
4391,glHQPkrcf8A,Why on earth would anyone want digital and print? This kind of nonsense works for American consumers who are not really smart. Indian users will go for digital coz it‚Äôs cheap and there is no point of print as well for the same thing. <br>The decoy effect is also used for Soda or coke. Small Medium and Large where medium doesn‚Äôt make sense and Large doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs too expensive compared to small. But smart consumers either buy what they need or not buy at all. I personally don‚Äôt care for sugar drinks but will pick small if I have to coz most of them have free refills anyway.,
4392,glHQPkrcf8A,Online shopping made this strategy obsolete,
4393,glHQPkrcf8A,"Great pricing lesson, thanks!!!",
4394,glHQPkrcf8A,I don&#39;t know why this guys buy popcorn at movies which was just 10rs on road and we never ate it on roads,
4395,glHQPkrcf8A,Apple uses the same strategy in its product lineup,
4396,glHQPkrcf8A,Well illustrated and facilitated learning.,
4397,glHQPkrcf8A,But if no one buys the decoy product then isn&#39;t it a waste in terms of dead inventory and the cost involved in manufacturing? Can the margins obtained from selling just budget and premium products be so much that they compensate for the zero sale of decoys?,
4398,glHQPkrcf8A,"However kindly convey if there are two kinds of people who go for extremes of prices, why go for decoy anyway?",

4402,TCboTQr8Ecg,Bro make a vedio on meesho,
4403,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nice thumbnail,
4404,TCboTQr8Ecg,Your videos are so incredibly informative and you somehow explain complicated concepts with a breeze! Thank you so much  for making these videos!!,
4405,TCboTQr8Ecg,"I soo agree, if I see don‚Äôt see the update / case study it feels the day went waste üòÇ",
4406,TCboTQr8Ecg,I thought flipkart is an Indian company,
4407,TCboTQr8Ecg,"They seem to have two major competitors, Purplle and Foxy",
4408,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Isnt flipkart an indian company, so why cant it work in the inventory model?",
4409,TCboTQr8Ecg,I thought I m the only one,
4410,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Dont order anything from nykaa...i ordered simple niacinamide serum..and the dropper was full of foggy germs and very dirty..when i contacted nykaa....and showed the pics...they completely disagree whereas other online platforms like myntra,big basket and all...gives immediate refund and tells us to dispose it...whereas nykaa gives money to celebrities but dosent give our own money back",
4411,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Hi, I am a big fan your channel.<br>There is something badly needed in India now and not available.<br><br>A list of potential Make in India products like <br>Nail Cutters<br>Gimbals <br>Escalator components <br>Pharma ingredients <br>Civilian drones<br>I don‚Äôt know, most of the gadget stuff on Amazon seems 2b made in China<br>And often the country of origin is not mentioned. Making it all the more suspect.",
4412,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Now as Nykaa has raised, it has started fooling customers like most of other ecom sites. They delete negative reviews and most of the reviews are fake. You cannot trust their product ratings AT ALL.",
4413,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa is winning because almost everyone on insta wants to be a makeup artist or beauty influencer. Makeup artists charge 40k per hour and do 2 to 5 clients per day. And they claim they use international brands but use shid products like PAC. There used to makeup videos for free on YouTube few years back but now everyone sells courses and workshops. Highly profitable business. 10s of lakhs per month solo person income.,
4414,TCboTQr8Ecg,Yea right..still think they are better than Amazon ? üòÄ,
4415,TCboTQr8Ecg,"purplle is a company with same facilities and came before nykaa, why did it fail?",
4416,TCboTQr8Ecg,PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO ON TATA ELXSI,
4417,TCboTQr8Ecg,Can someone explain how a inventory led model is superior to a marketplace? If someone‚Äôs starts a business like this where do you get the capital to invest in soo much stock? What happens if the stock does not sell through?,
4418,TCboTQr8Ecg,Just want to know how nykaa on the first place had a Money to buy such expensive makeup in bulk initially???,
4419,TCboTQr8Ecg,thanks brother for great guidance üôèüèª May God be with you and your team and families always üôèüèª,
4420,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa is just another fraudster company that&#39;s all. On top of that they charge more money on products which can be bought at cheaper rate at other online store or on shops.,
4421,TCboTQr8Ecg,More profit more tax,
4422,TCboTQr8Ecg,Bcoz the founder is an MBA in finance and a ca so focus was always on finance and profitability,
4423,TCboTQr8Ecg,Flipkart also an indian company so why they can&#39;t use inventory model,
4424,TCboTQr8Ecg,Flipkart is not indian company...WTFü§îü§î,
4425,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Just wanted to say in inventory model the e-commerce portal bleed like anything in terms of margins,  where they make a very little of profit compared to Marketplace model as the due to liability of Inventory and outright payments. Market place model is where they make the money, as the portal is just the platform to sell, without any stock liability and just charge of commission on the consumer sales.",

4440,TCboTQr8Ecg,Please make a case study on fabindia,
4441,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nyka sells original that&#39;s why it buys directly from brands.,
4442,TCboTQr8Ecg,My doubt is...so why cant Amazon India or Flipkart India both register subsidiaries or a cloud tail a vendor owned by Amazon but can be owned by an Indian do what Nykaa is doing?,
4443,TCboTQr8Ecg,Please use more video clips using Desi videos.,
4444,TCboTQr8Ecg,Every time I watched his video I get the ad of the company in which he is making video on. Like nyka ad in this video,
4445,TCboTQr8Ecg,Can you pls do let know why Myntra is better or popular than Nykaa fashion dealing in clothes n accessories,
4446,TCboTQr8Ecg,Damn good,
4447,TCboTQr8Ecg,Like you mentioned the inventory model can&#39;t be carried out by foreign players so amazon can&#39;t do but what about flipkart ?,
4448,TCboTQr8Ecg,I like your simple xplanations man. Keep it up,
4449,TCboTQr8Ecg,Make video on hyperlocal marketplace and whats gone wrong with local baniya amd paper tape and how to solve that.,
4450,TCboTQr8Ecg,Dude please get your facts right.,
4451,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Nykaa USP which I feel as a buyer: better transperancy of brands, better transperancy of products (it shows all shades of foundation for example, so you know which shades will suit you: it allows to see how foundation will look on different skin colour with a picture), clear instruction on how to use the product, expiry dates and ingredients also. And last but not the least, their packaging is top class, it makes the buyers feel that Nykaa has made sure that products reach with minimal or no damage. It gives a sense of value, care which the customers have placed on the products.",
4452,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa has been reported of selling counterfeit impoted products and also withdrawing delivery services from several previously deliverable locations. Still people continue to shop at nykaa because of the perception that it has a higher standard to competing e-commerce retailers,
4453,TCboTQr8Ecg,please make a video on  Amaraja battery also On Bitcoin Crypto  risk rating and usage,
4454,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Just wanted to add a few points here and there, the horrible in-store Nykaa experience is a real thing. Sephora hires way more experienced people; Nykaa, especially in tier 2 and 3 cities, lacks on that aspect. And that remains a market to be tapped. However, one thing that worked with Nykaa&#39;s own ranges has been its community and their intensive market research. The shade range that they offer is exceptional for brown skin-tones. Brands like MAC which operate across the world and cater to all skin shades are pricier, and in the section that is experimenting with, or exploring makeup, a good below 500 product is amazing. <br>Oh and they have an entire section of website only for makeup artists, specific offers and product ranges.",
4455,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nyka is the Sephora of India,
4456,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nyka also sends duplicate products. And also half empty ones,
4457,TCboTQr8Ecg,"I&#39;m watching this video, after watching nykaa adüî•",
4458,TCboTQr8Ecg,Beauty products themself are nonsense products. Day by day people will stop using these products.,
4459,TCboTQr8Ecg,I think soon nyaka will be swallowed by Amazon or flipkart. No unique value except inventory model. Fake products and customer awareness soon will be addressed by Amazon.,
4460,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa packing is good...,
4461,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Exactly I am actually purchase books from Amazon (they have good collection but recently delivery charges getting high )<br>For Dress and shoe , bags I trust Myntra and flipkart most <br>And for makeup Naayka always .",

4466,TCboTQr8Ecg,I love nykaa stores. They leave their products open and let the customer choose and check those by their own. It&#39;s very much comfortable. We get to choose what we want without having the seller pressure. And that&#39;s how we ended up buying what i really want not what the seller want us to buy.,
4467,TCboTQr8Ecg,@think school tell me what product have you bought from nykaa and what did you like the most in the product?,

4476,TCboTQr8Ecg,Superb!!!,
4477,TCboTQr8Ecg,But nykaa is not profitable!  It held back its marketing expenses of the previous quarter instead of showing it as cost. This automatically showed its balance sheet as healthy. It was  a simple case of window dressing.,

4587,er752AxyziE,"Would like to add few more points on Bessemer.Though Bessemer Convertor(1856) was revolutionary for Steel Industry it had several cons. Some info on Bessemer Convertor :<br>üìåBessemer is one of the earliest form of steel making. There are two types of bessemer process :<br>1. Acid bessemer process<br>2. Basic bessemer process<br><br>üöÄAcid / Basic represents the nature of refractory lining.<br>Acid bessemer process was the first to be found and later on basic bessemer process was found. Basic bessemer process is also known as Thomas process of steelmaking.<br><br>‚úÖ1.Acid bessemer process -<br>In steelmaking the impurities to be removed are C,Si, Mn and P.<br>Here C is a gas so no issues in its removal. Mn is also basic in nature so it is also removed without difficulty. But oxides of Si and P are acidic in nature , so they cannot be lowered in acid bessemer process. <br>The steel has high amount of Si, P and N after completion of process which is kinda bad. <br><br>‚úÖ2. Basic bessemer process :<br>Now since the lining is basic in nature Si, P can be lowered here unlike acid bessemer process. But still the problem of high N content in steel persists here due to usage of air as a oxidising agent.  Thus, Bessemer Process was later on replaced quickly and BOF became the go to SM process!<br><br>For more info feel free to check out the SM series here: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/metallurgy_daily/p/CR67KzPDpBq/?utm_medium=copy_link"">https://www.instagram.com/metallurgy_daily/p/CR67KzPDpBq/?utm_medium=copy_link</a>",

4611,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq is overrated,

4618,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq doesn&#39;t not offer 1 month free investment from them in harvest schemes. This is verified today.,
4619,urLoa8PkQpU,"I think you lack bit of a knowledge, you did your research only on the brand but not the trusted players of the market, Tanishq is a brand that&#39;s been propelled by Tata.<br><br>I hope you are aware about the BIS mark and hallmark and various other certification. Tanishq is just a fad, will eventually die out and give in to the local players. May not happen overnight, will definitely happen.<br>Quick Tip: next time do your research from both ends. Easy to sit on a mic and blabber what you find on the internet, next time dig deeper and go beneath atleast 2-3 layers of the market.",
4620,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq is for upper middle class but they have recently started focusing on low ticket  customer for jewellery by buying caratlane for 300-400 crores (for middle and lower middle),
4621,urLoa8PkQpU,"Over decades Jewelers of India have successfully brainwashed Indians into believing that buying gold jewelry is an investment rather than an expense, and have successfully made fools of a vast majority of Indians. Tanishq is no different. If you want to invest in gold, buy stock in gold mining firms, gold coins and bricks. Buying jewelry is a sure way to make a loss. Jewelers profit when one buys or sells jewelry.  Don&#39;t trust any jeweler.",
4622,urLoa8PkQpU,That was great man.. it was insightful üëèüëè,
4623,urLoa8PkQpU,"Being in the jewelry industry since1989, most of the points that you have mentioned are agreeable, But I don&#39;t agree that local seller looted their loyal customers. There might be a few scammers but not most as you have said. unfortunately, one rotten apple makes the whole bunch look bad.<br>But there&#39;s a new trend of scammers with Lab-Grown Diamonds, How they mislead cousotmers into believing that Lab-grown is somehow as valuable as Natural diamond by comparing both of them side by side, just to sell you Lab-grown. I think that needs to be pointed out in this diamond jewelry industry.",
4624,urLoa8PkQpU,"Saw this video on youtube incognito, and finally, I subscribed and commented, I appreciate the hardship that went into making this video and case study. My mind blown.",
4625,urLoa8PkQpU,"&quot; killed&quot; is a wrong word. You must not have done any regular dealings with the local jewelers. If you had, you will not have used that word. <br>They always have a tendency of cheating the customer one way or the other, while on the other hand Tanishq has absolutely fair dealing.<br>You can compare Tanishq with local jewelers in as many aspects you want. May it be Purity of the gold, carat value declared with that of actual value, workmanship, after sales service and many more. You&#39;ll find tanishq better. <br>So a customer who can buy so expensive items, would always go for the best.",
4626,urLoa8PkQpU,The cheating thing for gold in local jwellers is very very true trust me,
4627,urLoa8PkQpU,"I am grateful to Tanishq for introducing the concept of a caratmeter wherein the customers can have the purity of their gold checked and evaluated....yes they are a brand and their making charges are high, no doubt but till Tanishq came into existence all &#39;small&#39; jewellers simply took the customers for a ride.....this is my personal experience...",
4628,urLoa8PkQpU,"So called small jewellers dug their own grave to some extent. in the 90s it was common that they cheat. they fleeced my family by selling us 18k gold bangles saying it it is 22 and charged for that too. happened a lot in many circles with diamonds and gold. ppl find branded stuff ugly and expensive but they feel at least genuine hoga. unfortunately, overtime its clear that that too is not reliable.",
4629,urLoa8PkQpU,Absolutely Stupid conclusion. When and where did it kill small jewellers? Extremely over priced products. quality of diamonds is pathetic. It&#39;s the most useless and pathetic brand ever. What are you high on Think school?,
4630,urLoa8PkQpU,Please do a research on offline mobile shop economy,
4631,urLoa8PkQpU,"I bought a gold ring in Tanishq for 16k after 4 years the it turned into fake gold. So, the time will let you know what kind of gold you bought.",
4632,urLoa8PkQpU,LOVE YOUR VIDEO,
4633,urLoa8PkQpU,We all know how most jewellers in India earn so much money üåö,
4634,urLoa8PkQpU,After the controversy on Diwali ad. I tried different brands and showrooms and surprisingly they have much better products with huge price difference. And now days every good jeweller gave you guaranty card of purity so trust issue is also resolved....,
4635,urLoa8PkQpU,"Not sure about quality. But making charges is very high. No idea whether others play with purity?  Any expert opinion please. 2 days back, wr visited The counter",
4636,urLoa8PkQpU,I think maker of this video has not visited Laxmi Road in Pune and Dadar Mumbai (or Sarafa in any other city).<br><br>Tanishq has hardly killed anyone. Just visit above mentioned places a week before Diwali,

4639,urLoa8PkQpU,Being a tanishq super fan ..i always felt happy to buy from tanishq .it&#39;s a tata product and its worth it,
4640,urLoa8PkQpU,it is not a worth store for buying. you don&#39;t  get value for money.,
4641,urLoa8PkQpU,Smalll jwellers loot people may b they charge less but they fraud with amount of gold that they put in gold aftr using it for a while for months the gold colour start fading and look almost look lik brass,
4642,urLoa8PkQpU,TanishQ is indian company owned by TATA,
4643,urLoa8PkQpU,"Agree with Sindhuja, it did&#39;nt kill anyone. Even today traditional jewellers are doing well and their designs are improving. Think School team needs to conduct more  research on its topics.",

4650,urLoa8PkQpU,Only good showrooms normal design gold with a high making charges,
4651,urLoa8PkQpU,But Making Charges are high at tanishq compared to others,
4652,urLoa8PkQpU,I am from Karnataka. Tanishk is not famous,

4658,urLoa8PkQpU,"Please visit Kerala Tanishq is nothing there.. Bhima, Kalyan, Malabar, Joy Alukkas, Josco etc are popular..",
4659,urLoa8PkQpU,Mainly through overpricing items. Collection is extremely unique no doubt.,

4662,urLoa8PkQpU,Well .. with Tata brand and Tanishq run like a corporate. At least when it comes to purity of Gold . Trust of gold is pivotal..I think that‚Äôs where Tanishq scores. Gold trust,
4663,urLoa8PkQpU,My mother visited tanisq but didn&#39;t buy anything instead bought from a local jeweler,
4664,urLoa8PkQpU,design to h hi nhi bakwas aur boring hai unnecessary show off hai bas,
4665,urLoa8PkQpU,"Most local jewellers sell gold coins of 99.95% purity. Tanishq sells 99.99 % purity coins. For that difference, they charge Rs 5000 extra",
4666,urLoa8PkQpU,Ground reality is something different. In my town it has been closed down,
4667,urLoa8PkQpU,"Small Indian jewellers are notorious for cheating customers ,there is no guarantee to the quality of gold they sell and they are not at all reliable . Tanishq did a huge favour to consumers",

4669,urLoa8PkQpU,"Not at all Tata is still a underdog in jewellery business. The big players are kerala based jewellers like Kalyan ,Malabar, joy allukas ,josco and many more.",
4670,urLoa8PkQpU,Stupid video..it is local gold traders who get more business because of trust..big brands like this are good in advertisement and they get only upmarket clients who are not even 0.001% of population,
4671,urLoa8PkQpU,If you were Tanisqe jewellery you don&#39;t have to wear sarees pallu just show off everything if u wear Tanishq brand.<br>We Indian love other Indian jewelry. We hate deshdhrohi padukon.,

4678,urLoa8PkQpU,In Chennai local GRT brand that runs for now around 70 years is far more better than Titan,
4679,urLoa8PkQpU,Not a good decision to go for gold ornaments there ! Huge disappoint! Switched back to known local manufacturers,
4680,urLoa8PkQpU,"Really surprise to see this video. Tanishq has not even captured total 5% of jwelly market and it 95% is still owned by small jwellers, Get your fact corrected.",
4681,urLoa8PkQpU,I guess this video is a little too outdated as the gov itself has took very good steps like hallmarking to improvise trust in the local jeweler rather than brands. Bcoz branding is causing waisting peoples money which could indeed be used to buy more gold. Secondly daimond is not what indians want to buy you should do a little more research. And be careful something big will come in a year or two which will empower the local jewels more over these brands with a more market trust and very big competition for all such brandsüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ,

4684,urLoa8PkQpU,Far Fetched.,
4685,urLoa8PkQpU,Local jewellers are far better in every expects.. the after sale service they only give us. If you purchase something from tanishq and after 1 month it got damaged then they will suggest you to exchange the product and pay making charges of the new product..<br> Isse chutiya banana nhi kahenge to kya kahenge.. vo us fact ko customer ko nhi samjhynge ki aap exchange karte hai to ek to purane wale saman ka making charges+ GST loss jayega aur new saman jo lenge usme fir se making charges aur GST lagega.. vo aisa gol gol samjhynge hame ki sir aapka koi deduction thori kia ja rha hai bas making charges lagenge aur exchange ho jayega....<br>  Wahin local jwellers bahut jyada damaged jwellery ko bhi repair karwa dete hai aur suggest karte hai ki jitna din aur pahan sakti hn pahan lijiye kuki nuksan to hona hi hai making charges ka abhi karo ya baad me...<br>Tanishq sirf kisi tarah meetha meetha bol kar lootna jaanta hai,

4689,urLoa8PkQpU,Don&#39;t make false statements. Your analysis is wrong. Skilled working small jewelry shops are ever green and dependable. Bharath people will prefer small jewelry shops rather than corporate ones. So work out on a topic deeply and then make analysis...,
4690,urLoa8PkQpU,"In kerala atleast we have ton of brands like Kalyan, Bhima, Joy Alukkas, Malabar gold , Josco and many others. Tanishq will be the last in line if none of the above shops are open on a holidayüòÇüòÇ. Their making charges are ridiculous.",
4691,urLoa8PkQpU,Seriously cause of that purity meter &amp; gold harvest scheme now I only buy gold from Tanishq brand...he pointed out the same thing...very well researched kudos to you &amp; your channel üòç‚ù§Ô∏è,
4692,urLoa8PkQpU,Buy a hallmarked jwellery from your local trusted jwellers...now a days it&#39;s not easy to cheat if you are aware of the norms..... Branded showrooms have v higher making charges and other charges...,
4693,urLoa8PkQpU,Khazana and lalitha is not charging wastage,
4694,urLoa8PkQpU,Their commercials are disappointing. They are trying to woo A small set of customer group ignoring large. Well it is just matter of few days to complete rejection. This business is much different than other tata brands. Stands out clearly for trying to be woke,
4695,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq not good,
4696,urLoa8PkQpU,Only on Purity Tanisq is assured compared to others. Others are saying 22  karat but purity is not maintained so.,
4697,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq is bad,
4698,urLoa8PkQpU,"you need a gold shop in every major town in jalgaon, maharastra because we have a ritual during marriage that we collect the gods (gold sheets with kul dev engraved on it) and polish them and then the Devatas participate in the marriage",
4699,urLoa8PkQpU,"Local owners used to cheat a lot, they will charge for 22k but when we went to tanishq and senco both said only 18k... So it&#39;s breach of trust",

One is Swami Vivekananda traveling to parliament of religions in Chicago via Japan, Canada and then to land in U.S. Another person is Jamshetji Tata, travelling to the west to study industrial sites. Swamiji comes to know of Jamshetji being onboard and meets him. After they get to know each other, Swamiji suggests to Jamshetji to start a company that is into research and development apart from the companies he already had. Swamiji says this research will help India in the long run. They soon reach their ports of departure. Years later in 1909, Jamshetji with help of Krishna Raja wadiyar , the then maharajah of Mysore establishes the Indian institute of science. Imagine how a sanyasi along with a great industrialist kick starts indian R&amp;D center.",

4941,Z7P-t_yc8gE,It is always a case of a business venture once it crosses its boundaries the growth is self propelled...Brand name&#39;s popularity will do the trick...Like TATA Bata Amul Golgate.etc..Haldirams are addictive especially Bhujia ..so once consumed stay a consumer for life..In politics Modi is a brand ...Movies Rajinikanth... business tycoon Adani...,
4942,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"Haldiram despite selling pricy products uses Palm oil which comes from destroying rainforests in Malaysia. It also uses cotton seed oil which in turn is GM seed oil as 95% of the cotton grown in India is GM. Its packged products has quite good number of flavouring agents, colouring agents and chemicals many of which are carcinogenic and banned in EU. They also generate copious amount  of plastic waste. My two cents - buy local, package free or make it at home.",

5083,vkrBQCQLQG0,"Everyone in the comments thinks that by watching this video they have gained knowledge of the video game industry. BUT THIS VIDEO HAS A LOT OF MISINFORMATION AND HE HAS CHOSEN TO IGNORE A LOT OF DATA. Let me break it down :<br>1) He says that console &amp; PC has very less accessibility and very limited market. That is completely false. Consoles are used in 250M households around the world which is more than amount of households that have Netflix(200M) . More than 3 Billion people play video games today. That is more than half of the connected world. 2 billion of those play on mobile. 1 billion play on console and PC. How can you call a market with 1 billion consumers limited? And in 2 Billion mobile market, 1 billion are from India( around 400-450M players) and third world countries where console and PC penetration is low. Approximately less than 1 billion who play mobile are in areas where console &amp; PC penetration is moderate to high like US, UK, Europe and the west. Even though there are 1 billion gamers in those areas, there are actual statistics that show that those people spend more on console &amp; PC than in mobile. One of The biggest fallacy in this video is that he calls $100B top-line business &quot;limited market&quot;. He says that $300-400 consoles are barriers to entry while ignoring that on average people in New York spend $300 PER WEEK ON Groceries. People in the west spend thousands of dollars on phones and you call consoles expensive? Consoles are only expensive in countries like India, Brazil, Africa etc.. because of low income and high import taxes, not surprising because only 5% percent of mobiles sold in India are more than ‚Çπ40,000($550). Consoles are inexpensive devices in the west and that&#39;s why almost every household has a console or a PC and why in countries like India you don&#39;t find a console or a PC in any of the households.",

Outsourcing in food is a recipe for disaster. <br>We got a legend and in today&#39;s startup culture shall we see his spirit again in the products we use is a question. <br>Still I appreciate your effort in bringing the story behind a true Indian.

5358,8rulgRgwHYc,"Not to be rude and I am Muslim myself but nonetheless, Islam is the most backward and orthodox sort of religion in the world. <br>I personally respect and believe that there every religion leads to God and names can be different but God is one but I would be charged with blasphemy and what not if I said it openly. <br><br>Women are not treated equally like men in various aspects. No equal right in property, divorce settlement etc. <br><br>Extremism and inolerance is among the highest. <br><br>Pick up any Islamic country except for one or two ( and I am being liberal in counting) none is secular or allows open religious activities to other Faith. <br><br>I personally am very happy with UCC, NRC because I donot want to share my right to resources in this country with someone coming from outside. And those who have illegal irrational reasons  to come should be thrown out. <br><br>Our nation was divided because some extreme elements of Islam wanted an Islamic country of their own. So they formed Pakistan and Bangladesh. And now they are not happy so they want to come back, like wtf. <br>If you want to come back bring back the resources you represent, bring back that part of land and we will give you citizenship, simple. <br>And who is religiously unhappy Muslim in a Muslim country.<br> These are all fowl claims and ranting of desperate people who want to drain Indian resources. <br>We must not let them do it.",

5362,8rulgRgwHYc,UNEMPLOYMENT MUST BE SEVERELY REDUCED IN 2 OR 3 TIER CITIES IN ORDER TO MAKE INDIA A SUPERPOWER. MODI GOVT. MUST LOOK UPON THIS.,
5363,8rulgRgwHYc,What is the update on PLI in 2022?,
5364,8rulgRgwHYc,yes if we send all the fundamental peacelovers to pakistan or afghanistan.,

5367,8rulgRgwHYc,"Lol!  Don&#39;t make castles in the air. What reality is you know very well as well as we are. India is just consumer market for multinational companies. Where people give votes issue of religion, where people  are called for 5to7 kids just for increasing population base on religion , how we can become superpower.",
5368,8rulgRgwHYc,trade wars are basically countries telling each other &quot;i&#39;m not gonna buy/sell (insert product) to you&quot;,

5371,8rulgRgwHYc,"People of our country are too toxic towards criticism. They can&#39;t hear any bad points about infrastructure, government, economy, culture, food, they don&#39;t think people have different preference or in something we are lacking. They think we are superior than every other country out there in everything but that a negative approach like this we will never grow. People don&#39;t contribute toward making India a superpower but dream about it. When this mentality will change and we see our mistake and work toward fixing it then then India will grow.",
5372,8rulgRgwHYc,"If you want manufacturing to flourish in India, first address labour laws to allow free hire &amp; fire without government permission.",

5375,8rulgRgwHYc,Ofcourse,
5376,8rulgRgwHYc,Real growth happens when Indian companies in a foreign land make business and bring foreign currency to their homeland.,
5377,8rulgRgwHYc,"I don&#39;t get HOW Indians can still believe this crap?! Y&#39;all are gonna be so surprised how things turn out within a decade.<br>The foremost requirements for being a superpower is economic superiority which, today, comes from technology and innovation. India is a dud in both.<br>Those advocating that India is high tech better familiarise themselves with the current world tech scenarios in battery tech, additive manufacturing, BCIs, organic printing etc. These and many more are areas of which India is not even aware of, let alone have a presence.<br>Our tech is borrowed, we are not innovative, we don&#39;t give any manufactured product to the world. Made in India is NOT a mark of reliability in ANY manufactured product.<br>Despite being a nation of 1.4 billion people and having NO sizeable constraints, our level of industrialization is minimal &amp; we are becoming a service oriented economy...that too for internal consumption. Most of our start ups are in fintech &amp; designed for use in India only.<br>India can NEVER become a superpower. Not unless the Indian society changes and people start getting empathetic. This is the starting point to innovation &amp; growth. We develop empathy as a society, then, maybe in two or three generations, we can start talking about ruling the world.<br>Till then, such stupid talks are only lip service to our cognitive dissonance, which is there aplenty in all Indians, thanks to our overinflated egos.<br>What we don&#39;t realise is how precarious the situation is becoming. The West is aggressively moving towards automation in ALL areas. Which means heavy reduction in manual tasks, leading to lesser jobs. India can expect a lot of expats returning home within a decade.<br>The world&#39;s top soil is eroding. Post 2050, India will start losing its single biggest global advantage area of food production as better farming tech grows abroad.<br>India will be used by the world as a market only...like it&#39;s being used today. People will be paid highly for working in foreign owned companies that have set up shop in India. But despite having a high salary will live hand to mouth because everything will be very expensive.<br>The future of India is high unemployment, high crime &amp; govt controlled living. The time has almost run out. If something is not done to make India globally relevant in terms of economics by 2030, this country and its people are doomed.<br>But I don&#39;t see any attempt by anyone towards this direction.",
5378,8rulgRgwHYc,Govt of India should not see states in which the party is not in power as separate ones ..,
5379,8rulgRgwHYc,We wont as long as Center sees states and state mistakes as oppurtunity for them to come in power.<br>Instead of guiding them and commanding them strictly of state  policies ruining states . Example Andhra Pradesh <br><br>Its letting Ap people to feed by state govt and making  us go bank rupt and center.

Any political party does not believe to divide the community, keep people poor to rule should be abolished. Secular truly,  follow Gandhian principle, India will rule the world.",
5383,8rulgRgwHYc,"Super power needs millions of High Tech. work force. Free, compulsory, 4 yr. college education for &quot;All Indian Citizens, without discrimination&quot;. 4 yrs. college in &quot;STEM&quot; (Science, Tech. Eng. Math.

Quality control is beyond reach}. The return on investment is 40%, over the working life of a student, who pays Federal taxes. Out of the hundreds of thousands graduates yearly, at MIT standards, a small percent of genius PhDs emerge and lead the industries. A lot of talent leaves the country for better prospects. Keep on producing talented work force. Indian labor is inexpensive, educated, in a Democracy with 125 million people speaking English. This becomes an incentive for foreign companies to invest in India.",
5384,8rulgRgwHYc,"This didn&#39;t aged well. You were really optimistic in this video - but the truth is most of the companies that left china didn&#39;t setup in India but preferred countries like - Vietnam, Thailand etc. Thus india missed out lot of opportunity which could change the shape of our economy but nowadays apart from some YouTube channels and educated people - most of the people are not focused on development and doesn&#39;t give a damn about economics but are more Or less influenced by hatred towards minority. Ki kam kma lenge but ye log barbaad ho jaye. Youth leaving 5%-10% of them others are going down the path of hatred thus not focusing on learning any skill + violence and hate along with poor infrastructure led to company not considering  setup  in india. Also the issue of brain drain which at some point of time was a great matter of concern is being neglected today when this issue is very dominant. Most of the highly talented person the top 1 percent of the 1 percent actually leave this country and contribute to economy of foreign nation. India being a superpower was a reality that could have been achieved if our country had the same pace and perception when this was a main issue but for now it&#39;s far from reality and if what&#39;s happening -the most concerning issue of division and hate propaganda is not stopped this dream would remain a dream .",
5385,8rulgRgwHYc,"hello Think School can you explain this: &quot;Why are billions being invested into Indian non-profitable startups by VCs when it is well known that today the cost of acquisition (CAC) is much higher than the lifetime value (LTV) of customers in most B2C businesses?<br>They have two hypotheses:<br>India is at around $2K per capita GDP, and the bet is that it will be at $4K in a few years from now. $4K is when the magic is supposed to happen, as it did in China. Essentially a bet on rising disposable incomes and increasing purchasing power.<br>India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. 10s of billions of $s are waiting to enter India, no way around it.

They are business minded but their business itself a revolution in each and every field for enriching a common man by all means. We lost Anil Ambani sir but still waiting for his resurgence to the nation&#39;s wellness.

I work from home and airtel internet just work fine without any lag.<br>Having said that I always have a jio sim with me. If their internet service will improve, I will readily switch from airtel to jio. They also do not cost any money to keep sim active without recharge. Their plans are also cheaper than airtel.

5428,yhpVAki47RI,"Loved the video but to be honest and in my opinion, Airtel survived from the looted money from the customers which it got by randomly activating VAS services on customers&#39; accounts and charging a premium amount to rack millions unless the customer goes to their customer support centers and deactivated it. Many gullible and innocent people never even knew that this kind of service had been activated on their SIM. <br><br>I like the idea of phone recharge vouchers which are available now where customers pay some advance sum and get the service and nothing else can be activated by these fraudsters (Airtel in this case)<br><br>Edit: Looking at the comments made by other people I can totally see how this issue resonates everywhere when it comes to Airtel.

5466,yhpVAki47RI,Big Thanks for airtel  becoz I&#39;m watching this video  ( 0 kbps ) üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°,
5467,yhpVAki47RI,Nice information üëç,
5468,yhpVAki47RI,I never got good coverage with Airtel,
5469,yhpVAki47RI,It&#39;s truly inspiring greatness. Keep it going with more knowledge add ons with current happenings,
5470,yhpVAki47RI,Vodafone is looteri company,
5471,yhpVAki47RI,Because jio tried to do monopoly. It&#39;s simcards do not operate in sim 2.,
5472,yhpVAki47RI,It is the responsibility of the people here to maintain a &quot;equally competitive company&quot; within the sector to ensure the quality of the other!!,
5473,yhpVAki47RI,Beating competition by providing worst network<br>Jio is still the leader<br>Bullshit airtel,
5474,yhpVAki47RI,Can you please start a series on different &quot;Industry Analysis&quot;,
5475,yhpVAki47RI,This is result of over analysing the situation and making a fool of yourself.<br><br>Jio is playing with market and do not want the blood strains on sleeve.,
5476,yhpVAki47RI,"Basically it is duopoly, ready to exploit !",
5477,yhpVAki47RI,JIO BROADBAND NO ISSUES.  AIRTEL friends find connection problems,
5478,yhpVAki47RI,Whatever joe might have done but still the network issues with Jio my god irritate so much airtel is still ok in terms of network but both are equally worse in my view always have so much issue with network and internet ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è,
5479,yhpVAki47RI,Abhi and neyu,
5480,yhpVAki47RI,"Great example!<br>This is the mistake Blackberry did<br>The moment they removed the exclusivity of BBM, they completely lost the war",
5481,yhpVAki47RI,"Pathetic network in BLR, I am Vodafone customer, beginning I just ported to jio postpaid. I made mistake. I&#39;m going back to Vodafone are Airtel!üôè",
5482,yhpVAki47RI,"The ecosystem has changed the whole perspective of business. As an IT employee I can also see several companies who are leveraging their ecosystems around the world.<br>Apple: iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iWatch, MacBook, Final Cut Pro, Siri etc.<br>Google: Google Workspace, Android, Google TV, Wear OS, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Assistant etc.<br>Microsoft: Office 365, Windows, Azure, MS Teams, Xbox, Power BI, MS SQL etc. Microsoft can easily create Windows for phones but that remains to be seen.<br>Adobe: Acrobat Reader, Photoshop, Lightroom, Premier etc.<br>Meta: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus.<br>Oracle: Java, Database, Cloud services etc.<br>Amazon: E-commerce, Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Kindle etc.<br>Disney: Marvel, Star Wars, Nat Geo, Disney, Hotstar, Disney+ etc.<br><br>Overall, you can only survive without an ecosystem if your product is better than the ecosystem product. Example: PlayStation, Spotify, Twitter, AWS etc.",
5483,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel pulled off a Jio,
5484,yhpVAki47RI,"Great Insights man. I learned a lot from the video. Though a lot us implicitly knew about the ecosystem created by Apple, but articulating it by breaking it down actually made it an actionable insight-entry level, Retainer &amp; upsells.",
5485,yhpVAki47RI,airtel charged 256 rs for 1GB . why will they go bankrupt?. they looted enough,
5486,yhpVAki47RI,content- üëçüëç<br>background music - fed up ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è,
5487,yhpVAki47RI,i wish airtel would not have survived as well it has the worst network and poor costumer services just promising advertisement are gr8,
5488,yhpVAki47RI,I think i am choosing Airtel only because of its high speed that is the first and last reason and when jio lauch i choose it because of its less price even today jio has less price and Airtel has more speed but i choose idea because in my area it&#39;s speed is high and it is soo cheap and give free internet as well..üòÇüòÇ,
5489,yhpVAki47RI,jIo destroyed others.that was gud.,
5490,yhpVAki47RI,"My first SIM was BSNL, then Vodafone ( Hutch) and then I switched to Airtel in 2010 and never switched! I never had to!",
5491,yhpVAki47RI,It&#39;s at the best interest of consumers to have all the 4 telecom players to be strong. Airtel &amp; Jio have been successful to have a good clout in the market<br>Despite huge debts &amp; AGR issue VI is continuing to provide service(which personally gave a pessimistic experience) <br>Government can resurrect BSNL to it&#39;s golden era of strength &amp; service standards by influx of Serious long-term investment(but i doubt it may happen),
5492,yhpVAki47RI,"So, the broadband actually saved the Airtel conglomerate",
5493,yhpVAki47RI,I don&#39;t think jio purposefully wants Airtel to stay in the market to avoid monopoly,
5494,yhpVAki47RI,Airtel didn&#39;t survive or beat Jio but got a kick up its back to get realistic in its price and quality thanks to Jio and simple economics of demand &amp; supply.,
5495,yhpVAki47RI,Kudos to you man üòÖ<br>Made an Airtel over Jio case study and got it sponsored by Moneycontrol (also owned by Reliance) üòÇüòÇ This makes me love the Internet even more.<br>Such good content should never stopüòÉ,

5498,yhpVAki47RI,Still the airtel ecosystem is very inferior and not user friendly compared to jio. Customer really struggles understanding the different schemes and the prices of airtel r too high compared to jio,

5641,tI9fRLNmNkY,"And how the DELL fail ? like we are not see much divice like we have from HP, ASUS, ETC.",
5642,tI9fRLNmNkY,8 yrs of my Pentium chip dell laptop it has held up super strong,
5643,tI9fRLNmNkY,I know more about Computers than your Entire Species. So You can&#39;t Trick me.<br>Michael Dell is Some Canadian King. A PC Assembler. I could do that at age 13. Its like Lego.<br>It wasn&#39;t Dell that killed IBM.<br>It was your Father / God and those Borg / Avatar.<br>They Reverse engineered the X86 and Z80 CPU chip atomic silicon.

5647,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Sir, app video q nahi hindi m bante ho",
5648,tI9fRLNmNkY,"You will have to make a distinction between IBM and Dell where the former has professional accounts and Dell goes direct to customers. <br>Any business model where businesses deal with their customers directly are bound to succeed. Say cinema ticket. <br>What can be learnt from Dell is care for customers.  You never feel left out and brand recall is good. <br>That&#39;s why Amazon is doing well as it reaches home where family members recollect the experience. <br>For lessons,  to out against the best in the industry is tough as you need the support system. <br>In India any founder need the govt to support his enterprise.  How about US. <br>Next time cover the role of govt in the big companies establishment. Only then we can have a 360 degree idea about any business that succeeds in large scale.",

5656,tI9fRLNmNkY,"Now, you need to watch Company Man&#39;s &quot;The decline of Dell&quot; after this.",
5657,tI9fRLNmNkY,"And it today&#39;s date you would buy a Dell only if it was a laptop coz their desktops are crap. Yes, institutions would buy from Dell coz they are able to bulk supply but individual consumers won&#39;t, unless you want to score a gpu on a fair-ish price along with the system. And most businesses go with Lenovo for some reason.",

5677,tI9fRLNmNkY,"One thing about Dell is eventually they were able to undercut the builders (myself being one of them back in the days). I used to build much better custom systems for my customers at less cost but once Dell got the costs down to where it was no longer profitable to &#39;build them&#39;, I started buying Dell&#39;s for my customers (albeit inferior to the systems I had been building in the past). There was a hitch as those low cost Dells we&#39;re hardly upgradable and cut corners with some &#39;mickey mouse&#39; stuff which meant they had a reduced usable lifetime (aka: disposable computers). Not bad for my business but not good for customers as they tended to hold on to those systems way beyond that &#39;stunted&#39; useful lifetime.<br><br>Generally, I don&#39;t buy Dells for myself (personal systems). However, they were ahead of the game on supporting Linux on their server lines which made them the &#39;go to&#39; for servers running linux and Dell has good support for Linux. However, this is changing and this &#39;niche&#39; is eroding. Like IBM, Dell is a company I suspect is a fading &#39;giant&#39; and really Lenovo has the edge. IBM is remaking itself and Dell will have to do the same before it&#39;s too late. <br><br>Ironically, much of the &#39;on-site&#39; support in the 90&#39;s I got from Dell were outsourced to IBM service people. I suspect Dell will need to get off the x86 processor monopoly or their fate will be tied to failing to diversify and will be undercut by less expensive ARM and possibly RISC-V power efficient alternatives. Dell is too tied to MS Windows and even MS has embraced Linux as Azure is their &#39;cash cow&#39; now and lumbering into ARM and we&#39;re getting to the point that the Linux desktop for the masses it&#39;s mature and the Windows monopoly will become a problem for this hardware company. Note: Dell does sell Laptops with Linux preinstalled but on the high end.... despite Linux usually entering in the recycle end (aka: EOL systems where Windows can&#39;t be upgraded and still be a useable system). This is a problem as Dell&#39;s desktops often die after the first 4 years (aka: disposable systems) and use cost cutting &#39;junk parts&#39; that have no long time support. AKA: not good for small businesses or countries looking to &#39;move away&#39; from the MS monopoly and reduce costs without losing productivity.",

5693,tI9fRLNmNkY,i don&#39;t know.hp sells more in india I think..,
5694,tI9fRLNmNkY,how does just in time system make the delivery faster. Is that that they employ more skilled professionals since they have capital saved from not opting for inventory?,
5695,tI9fRLNmNkY,"One correction,  the statement of IBM don&#39;t own is misleading. I studied IBM PCs and clones for a year, and It was IBM who brought architecture of segregating Memory (ram), processor and internal and external drives for memory and made the architecture Free for all as a service to computer industry.  <br>Also when companies had policy of take all profits by making all by themselves, IBM had strict policy like SAP and few other companies of partnerships and growing together. they chose this route deliberately to see world as we see today. the bus to connect hardware, 8bit and 16 bit memory address were all ibms design. IBM still own the design and architecture we use today and allowed all to use and compete with IBM without issue. <br><br>IBM was the one who invented computer in first place and without them none of these technologies even existed. Also, IBM designed personal computers and helped computer industry thrive...so saying IBM failed and Dell did better than IBM and hence Dell better than IBM  is completely misleading. Even today Dell uses IBM architecture and has not invented new architecture. IBM  helped industry thrive and clones such as Dell and hp and acer and all other companies make money and boast about it..",

5758,iQRe7OHtHXg,"So despite paying colocation charges there were some brokers who dint benefit from the service bcs the brokers who had logged into the servers first would receive information faster than those compared to the other brokers. So in all there were three types of brokers - brokers who paid co location charges and had first mover advantage, second are the brokers who paid co location charges but were logged in a lil late on the servers and the third are individual investors like us who had access to information the last . Is this understanding right ?",
5759,iQRe7OHtHXg,It&#39;s absurd that we do don&#39;t get to see this on tv where we pay monthly charges without hesitation and here we are seeing it for free and they have to get wait for sponsors to get paid,
5760,iQRe7OHtHXg,Co-Location to NSE server is a Crime and allowing such priority provision by SEBI is a criminal offence. If indian Government is not stopping this immediately it shows Governments inability or an indirect YES to the offence that&#39;s going on. regards,

5763,iQRe7OHtHXg,"sorry to say This all is just Hyped!! Concerned about that lag with data? Even today, Try placing order over web through IBT based Discount Brokers and observe how much Lag you get. Thats what you should be concerned about more. Even today this Market orders comes with slippages but they are discounted while the model is being created Or the other hand Limit orders comes into play with almost negligible to 0 slippage if you want that level of precision (which again are sent to Exchange pre-hand so again incoming data lag doesn&#39;t matter). For Hedge Funds to reduce latency, they&#39;d be in Colocation already (Also that much slippages you mentioned in video are nothing as they itself buy in many Legs across various periods). Long short that lag practically made 0 impact from investors perspective as that level of precision in market Orders didn&#39;t mattered.

5843,8tBuAM0XHmY,Good thing about kerala is its stuck in 1960s 1970s timeline. No industrial pollution. No mass transit development programs.  Everything nice and slow. All hard working malyalis overseas send their remittance home to family. Very idyllic way of life.,
5844,8tBuAM0XHmY,The tagline &#39;God&#39;s own country&#39; is surely overrated.,

5849,8tBuAM0XHmY,Proud of our state Kerala.,
5850,8tBuAM0XHmY,But currently kerala state govt is struggling financially. The vision and dedication showed by the govt 20-25 years back was not taken over properly for sustainable development by the governments that followed. People are tax drained in every way possible. This will surely affect tourism here. Youth in kerala are leaving abroad. Soon kerala will be &quot;Olds own country&quot;.<br><br>- keralite.,
5851,8tBuAM0XHmY,"It‚Äôs not strategy. Kerala is just damn beautiful. I‚Äôve been to many places in India in 1993 as a child, and Kerala just took the mantle for the most beautiful place in India.",

5855,8tBuAM0XHmY,I visited Chikmagalur last month and was appalled with the lack of civic sense among our Desi Tourists. Plastic and beer bottles dumped everywhere. There is a huge tourist inflow without much marketing by the inept state government. Responsible tourism can come only with government intervention.,

5862,8tBuAM0XHmY,China should also promote industry the same way,
5863,8tBuAM0XHmY,One thing I like to improve in Kerala is roadway. It takes 5-6hours to reach 150kms without traffic. Roads are good but most of them are 2 lanes only. If Kerala build high speed railways between important cities then it will be game changer,
5864,8tBuAM0XHmY,Shall I remind you something irrespective of culture/ religion... let the tourists wear what ever they want don&#39;t stare...  and keep smiling because they contribute more than your millionaires,

6006,dVtnSPZn6BU,Great,
6007,dVtnSPZn6BU,"As son of a successful LIC agent, I have heard many discussion between an agent with the client. And it is my strongest view that LIC has been successful simply because it was seen as a government (backed) organization. There was times in 1980&#39;s and 1990&#39;s where many investment companies would open up and siphon off people&#39;s money. Hence there was a trust on government backed LIC that helped agents to convince customers that their money was safe. I agree some of the other comments below that some lic branch officers were rude and behaved like any other government officer. But for common public, the safety of money was of utmost importance that helped LIC a lot.",

Neither the products provide adequate cover, nor do they provide any meaningful returns. Yes, the policies work very well for the agents, who get a handsome commission - so this gives them massive incentives to mis-sell - and most victims are poor and the middle class.

6069,dVtnSPZn6BU,I must the LIC destroyed the meaning of Life Insurance because many have nightmare when policy get renewed or anything happens in between of premium payment time... In foreign countries people took an appointment of insurance officer to take an insurance... Now people don&#39;t have faith in the term insurance that&#39;s why they don&#39;t take it. I can confirm that in India 80% don&#39;t have insurance....,
6070,dVtnSPZn6BU,LIC is one of the most inefficient organization.. just check online premium and compare it with private players..LIC is a mechanism for government to milk any time..Most of the Failed OFS of PSUs were bailed by LIC...Mis selling is synonymous with LIC agents..sorry Ganesh not happy with glorifying such pathetic  organization,

6093,dVtnSPZn6BU,They can have a zoom call with LIC agent in Covid times. Its completely wrong to think people would go on to websites and purchase insurance in matter of 5 minutes. Insurance is still a costly affair and personal relationship with a agent gives us that secure feeling from inside who has been operating as an agent in our hyperlocal region for decades and have built relationship with our neighbours. Trust is a big factor for LIC. TATA brand is built on Trust and we know how the business is doing.,

6118,glHQPkrcf8A,"Wonderful explanation, I never thought of it‚Ä¶<br><br>One question: how Costco is more successful than ikea even though they don‚Äôt seem to apply decoy effect rather they believe in premium branding I think ‚Ä¶ I kind of see a paradox here",

6120,glHQPkrcf8A,Decoy ko samjhane 9 min time liya bhai aapne,
6121,glHQPkrcf8A,Just wanted to add one more thing - IKEA products come as DIY and it gives the satisfaction and quality. I personally prefer assembling my own furniture rather than by doing someone else haphazardly.,
6122,glHQPkrcf8A,"Best thing about IKEA is customer service. Easy to build furniture by our own, color theme matches across products. And also they are budget friendly.",
6123,glHQPkrcf8A,"Sorry, was very late to see this Video....and very impressed by the way you explain it. Yes it do inspires...but I have 2 questions regarding Decoy effect....<br><br>1. Isn&#39;t the decoy price of 5 dollar difference rom the premium commodity understandable for any customers who think in marketing way? While those who don&#39;t think that way are surely not premium customers and they go for lower price commodity.<br><br>2. Well this one is for you... Well what you describe through these videos are marketing strategies which IKEA or any companies don&#39;t want to reveal. Don&#39;t they react against you by exposing their ideas even though they are academic studies, which might effect their business?",
6124,glHQPkrcf8A,"Hmmm, I‚Äôm not sure if it will work for the SaaS offering.",
6125,glHQPkrcf8A,Music is good,
6126,glHQPkrcf8A,Ikea still has better products over the available market.That makes it easy for people to walk into their store.,
6127,glHQPkrcf8A,"product quality of Ikea is pathetic, it will not make any money in India. India is the toughest market in the World<br><br>They have not studied anything in India Market and they are selling European products in India",
6128,glHQPkrcf8A,U r aristotle dude,
6129,glHQPkrcf8A,"But in this method , arent we wasting  a product which is of 60$ just to make customer select 65$ product",
6130,glHQPkrcf8A,Key takeaway: never buy popcorn at theatre,

6151,glHQPkrcf8A,I don&#39;t think ....i experienced this decoy effect in IKEA....I found wat I needed,
6152,glHQPkrcf8A,small doubt <br>what about the product that is left as a decoy strategy. doesn&#39;t it pile up or is there any strategy to sell such products as well.,
6153,glHQPkrcf8A,"I have been following IKEA for over 2 decades and I have never found the &#39;decoy&#39; pricing methodology in practice in any part of the world. Also IKEA has been studying the Indian market for nearly a decade before committing itself to enter the Indian mkt. As an architect, we have learnt the hard way the decoy effect of proposing designs in a known gradation of quality. We deliberately show a bad/insufficient design along with a probable good design such the Client recognises shortfalls of the inadequate design and appreciates the fulfillment of the those deficiencies in the &#39;better&#39; design - where the entire thing is orchestrated.",

6168,glHQPkrcf8A,This looks like a scam. The website doesn&#39;t have any contact address. Only one link which makes you pay. Once you pay the money the system crashes and doesn&#39;t find a page. There is no communication from the website on the email address which they have gathered before taking your money. I want a full refund otherwise I&#39;m reporting you to the cyber cell.,

6185,glHQPkrcf8A,"I am sorry but the decoy pricing method that you share in this video (while the science of it makes sense and is applicable) is not a good explanation of why IKEA is so successful. <br><br>The absolutely main reason for their success is brilliant design for the price they charge. Period. <br><br>In addition to this, minimalistic design, creative functionality, retail store design, amazing packaging and outstanding DIY implementation also add to their success.<br><br>For a example, try and find - in India - a carpenter-made TV cabinet for the same design and price that IKEA will sell you. <br><br>It‚Äôs (almost) not possible. <br><br>Their sales are amazing because they get it right on so many levels (yes, including the cultural sensitivity of their target markets), not just pricing. Their retail store design is marketing genius. It makes you go through the store in a way that exponentially increases your chances to buy on a whim or impulse.<br><br>Form + function + reasonable prices. That‚Äôs why they sell truck loads of their products.",

6189,glHQPkrcf8A,Why you can&#39;t become to entrepreneur?,
6190,glHQPkrcf8A,To whomever reading this here is a little pun... If you see the laptop section in the description you can see that it directs to think pad since it&#39;s suggested by think school üòÉüòÄüòÇ I know it&#39;s not that funny,
6191,glHQPkrcf8A,Why on earth would anyone want digital and print? This kind of nonsense works for American consumers who are not really smart. Indian users will go for digital coz it‚Äôs cheap and there is no point of print as well for the same thing. <br>The decoy effect is also used for Soda or coke. Small Medium and Large where medium doesn‚Äôt make sense and Large doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs too expensive compared to small. But smart consumers either buy what they need or not buy at all. I personally don‚Äôt care for sugar drinks but will pick small if I have to coz most of them have free refills anyway.,
6192,glHQPkrcf8A,Online shopping made this strategy obsolete,
6193,glHQPkrcf8A,"Great pricing lesson, thanks!!!",
6194,glHQPkrcf8A,I don&#39;t know why this guys buy popcorn at movies which was just 10rs on road and we never ate it on roads,
6195,glHQPkrcf8A,Apple uses the same strategy in its product lineup,
6196,glHQPkrcf8A,Well illustrated and facilitated learning.,
6197,glHQPkrcf8A,But if no one buys the decoy product then isn&#39;t it a waste in terms of dead inventory and the cost involved in manufacturing? Can the margins obtained from selling just budget and premium products be so much that they compensate for the zero sale of decoys?,
6198,glHQPkrcf8A,"However kindly convey if there are two kinds of people who go for extremes of prices, why go for decoy anyway?",

6287,er752AxyziE,"Would like to add few more points on Bessemer.Though Bessemer Convertor(1856) was revolutionary for Steel Industry it had several cons. Some info on Bessemer Convertor :<br>üìåBessemer is one of the earliest form of steel making. There are two types of bessemer process :<br>1. Acid bessemer process<br>2. Basic bessemer process<br><br>üöÄAcid / Basic represents the nature of refractory lining.<br>Acid bessemer process was the first to be found and later on basic bessemer process was found. Basic bessemer process is also known as Thomas process of steelmaking.<br><br>‚úÖ1.Acid bessemer process -<br>In steelmaking the impurities to be removed are C,Si, Mn and P.<br>Here C is a gas so no issues in its removal. Mn is also basic in nature so it is also removed without difficulty. But oxides of Si and P are acidic in nature , so they cannot be lowered in acid bessemer process. <br>The steel has high amount of Si, P and N after completion of process which is kinda bad. <br><br>‚úÖ2. Basic bessemer process :<br>Now since the lining is basic in nature Si, P can be lowered here unlike acid bessemer process. But still the problem of high N content in steel persists here due to usage of air as a oxidising agent.  Thus, Bessemer Process was later on replaced quickly and BOF became the go to SM process!<br><br>For more info feel free to check out the SM series here: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/metallurgy_daily/p/CR67KzPDpBq/?utm_medium=copy_link"">https://www.instagram.com/metallurgy_daily/p/CR67KzPDpBq/?utm_medium=copy_link</a>",

6300,urLoa8PkQpU,The interview is about how tanishq made into market....due to tanishq ...other jwellers are forced to keep karatmeter and 18carat jwellery....the story  now is different due to tanishq only,
6301,urLoa8PkQpU,Hi <br>I watch all your videos.<br>This one has really helped me in my business.,
6302,urLoa8PkQpU,TN government co founder of Tanishq as well?,
6303,urLoa8PkQpU,"Of course!! Quality checks by Tanishq, aimed to undermine its competitors can be fully trusted!!",
6304,urLoa8PkQpU,"In Chennai and Kerala Joy Alukkas, Kalyan and Atlas jewellers are popular",
6305,urLoa8PkQpU,can you please have case study on GIVA,
6306,urLoa8PkQpU,"jyada guru matt bann ,  <br>very very  high making charge  at taniasq  shope.<br>i provide all type   jewellery  at only 15% making charge , and gold  rate  carat wise.",

6308,urLoa8PkQpU,0.15sec the graph scaling is wrong. Please fix it.,
6309,urLoa8PkQpU,This is a superb piece of a documentary; for that alone I subscribed to your channel.,
6310,urLoa8PkQpU,"Mr ganesh nice presentation. The whole Gold business of india is controlling by  a small of city Kerala name as Thrissur.. <br><br>80 % of gold manufacturing of the country by Thrissur product. The well known Thottan Group of  thrissur making jewels for Tanishq.. <br><br>The well known jewel brands of india  like kalyan, joy alukkas, jos alukkas, josco are the product of thrissur. <br><br>I have a request to do a case study about Thrissur",
6311,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq is overrated,
6312,urLoa8PkQpU,Better buy from manufacturers directly which has very less making charges plus hallmark they distribute to these stylish showrooms who charge so much in making charges,
6313,urLoa8PkQpU,"In business, pragmatism wins the day?  ü§î",
6314,urLoa8PkQpU,bro amazing case study <br>u have researched very deeply <br>this content should not be free <br>amazing,
6315,urLoa8PkQpU,&quot; The designs in India were mediocre &quot;. I think you slipped a little on this point. Indian jewelry and art designs r the most intricate in the world.,
6316,urLoa8PkQpU,"Poor vlogger !! Failed to research in Kerala ! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ check the Kerala brands - Kalyan , Bhima , Malabar , Jos allukkas !!! You will get contents for 5+ episodes !!",
6317,urLoa8PkQpU,Gotta feel sorry for those marwadis,
6318,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq doesn&#39;t not offer 1 month free investment from them in harvest schemes. This is verified today.,
6319,urLoa8PkQpU,"I think you lack bit of a knowledge, you did your research only on the brand but not the trusted players of the market, Tanishq is a brand that&#39;s been propelled by Tata.<br><br>I hope you are aware about the BIS mark and hallmark and various other certification. Tanishq is just a fad, will eventually die out and give in to the local players. May not happen overnight, will definitely happen.<br>Quick Tip: next time do your research from both ends. Easy to sit on a mic and blabber what you find on the internet, next time dig deeper and go beneath atleast 2-3 layers of the market.",
6320,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq is for upper middle class but they have recently started focusing on low ticket  customer for jewellery by buying caratlane for 300-400 crores (for middle and lower middle),
6321,urLoa8PkQpU,"Over decades Jewelers of India have successfully brainwashed Indians into believing that buying gold jewelry is an investment rather than an expense, and have successfully made fools of a vast majority of Indians. Tanishq is no different. If you want to invest in gold, buy stock in gold mining firms, gold coins and bricks. Buying jewelry is a sure way to make a loss. Jewelers profit when one buys or sells jewelry.  Don&#39;t trust any jeweler.",
6322,urLoa8PkQpU,That was great man.. it was insightful üëèüëè,
6323,urLoa8PkQpU,"Being in the jewelry industry since1989, most of the points that you have mentioned are agreeable, But I don&#39;t agree that local seller looted their loyal customers. There might be a few scammers but not most as you have said. unfortunately, one rotten apple makes the whole bunch look bad.<br>But there&#39;s a new trend of scammers with Lab-Grown Diamonds, How they mislead cousotmers into believing that Lab-grown is somehow as valuable as Natural diamond by comparing both of them side by side, just to sell you Lab-grown. I think that needs to be pointed out in this diamond jewelry industry.",
6324,urLoa8PkQpU,"Saw this video on youtube incognito, and finally, I subscribed and commented, I appreciate the hardship that went into making this video and case study. My mind blown.",
6325,urLoa8PkQpU,"&quot; killed&quot; is a wrong word. You must not have done any regular dealings with the local jewelers. If you had, you will not have used that word. <br>They always have a tendency of cheating the customer one way or the other, while on the other hand Tanishq has absolutely fair dealing.<br>You can compare Tanishq with local jewelers in as many aspects you want. May it be Purity of the gold, carat value declared with that of actual value, workmanship, after sales service and many more. You&#39;ll find tanishq better. <br>So a customer who can buy so expensive items, would always go for the best.",
6326,urLoa8PkQpU,The cheating thing for gold in local jwellers is very very true trust me,
6327,urLoa8PkQpU,"I am grateful to Tanishq for introducing the concept of a caratmeter wherein the customers can have the purity of their gold checked and evaluated....yes they are a brand and their making charges are high, no doubt but till Tanishq came into existence all &#39;small&#39; jewellers simply took the customers for a ride.....this is my personal experience...",
6328,urLoa8PkQpU,"So called small jewellers dug their own grave to some extent. in the 90s it was common that they cheat. they fleeced my family by selling us 18k gold bangles saying it it is 22 and charged for that too. happened a lot in many circles with diamonds and gold. ppl find branded stuff ugly and expensive but they feel at least genuine hoga. unfortunately, overtime its clear that that too is not reliable.",
6329,urLoa8PkQpU,Absolutely Stupid conclusion. When and where did it kill small jewellers? Extremely over priced products. quality of diamonds is pathetic. It&#39;s the most useless and pathetic brand ever. What are you high on Think school?,
6330,urLoa8PkQpU,Please do a research on offline mobile shop economy,
6331,urLoa8PkQpU,"I bought a gold ring in Tanishq for 16k after 4 years the it turned into fake gold. So, the time will let you know what kind of gold you bought.",
6332,urLoa8PkQpU,LOVE YOUR VIDEO,
6333,urLoa8PkQpU,We all know how most jewellers in India earn so much money üåö,
6334,urLoa8PkQpU,After the controversy on Diwali ad. I tried different brands and showrooms and surprisingly they have much better products with huge price difference. And now days every good jeweller gave you guaranty card of purity so trust issue is also resolved....,
6335,urLoa8PkQpU,"Not sure about quality. But making charges is very high. No idea whether others play with purity?  Any expert opinion please. 2 days back, wr visited The counter",
6336,urLoa8PkQpU,I think maker of this video has not visited Laxmi Road in Pune and Dadar Mumbai (or Sarafa in any other city).<br><br>Tanishq has hardly killed anyone. Just visit above mentioned places a week before Diwali,
6337,urLoa8PkQpU,Amazing content!,
6338,urLoa8PkQpU,"Boss u r outdated , Now they don‚Äôt provide 1 month discount.",
6339,urLoa8PkQpU,Being a tanishq super fan ..i always felt happy to buy from tanishq .it&#39;s a tata product and its worth it,
6340,urLoa8PkQpU,it is not a worth store for buying. you don&#39;t  get value for money.,
6341,urLoa8PkQpU,Smalll jwellers loot people may b they charge less but they fraud with amount of gold that they put in gold aftr using it for a while for months the gold colour start fading and look almost look lik brass,
6342,urLoa8PkQpU,TanishQ is indian company owned by TATA,
6343,urLoa8PkQpU,"Agree with Sindhuja, it did&#39;nt kill anyone. Even today traditional jewellers are doing well and their designs are improving. Think School team needs to conduct more  research on its topics.",
6344,urLoa8PkQpU,bro this guy is Very good analyst,
6345,urLoa8PkQpU,i visited that store once. everything was overpriced. title is a lie!,
6346,urLoa8PkQpU,Ad,
6347,urLoa8PkQpU,small jwellers are doing well tanishiq cannot make difference to them,
6348,urLoa8PkQpU,I think tanishq doesn&#39;t give 916 gold,
6349,urLoa8PkQpU,Wholesome content. Kudos to you.,
6350,urLoa8PkQpU,Only good showrooms normal design gold with a high making charges,
6351,urLoa8PkQpU,But Making Charges are high at tanishq compared to others,
6352,urLoa8PkQpU,I am from Karnataka. Tanishk is not famous,
6353,urLoa8PkQpU,"why all indian youtubers use foreigners to convey sonethung. for example here the youtuber us ss peajing abiut Indian oublic but showing a non Indian public at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urLoa8PkQpU&amp;t=8m42s"">8:42</a>",

6355,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq  making charge is very high.i never go to taneshq.,
6356,urLoa8PkQpU,Good job by Tanishq I hope they get you too,
6357,urLoa8PkQpU,I think<br>They in fact make people value local Jewellers more as they are way too overpriced and not up to the mark!! <br>This time not good research on your part!!!,
6358,urLoa8PkQpU,"Please visit Kerala Tanishq is nothing there.. Bhima, Kalyan, Malabar, Joy Alukkas, Josco etc are popular..",
6359,urLoa8PkQpU,Mainly through overpricing items. Collection is extremely unique no doubt.,
6360,urLoa8PkQpU,Try to make video within 10 minutes..,
6361,urLoa8PkQpU,"un understand able videos Sydney Australia <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>",
6362,urLoa8PkQpU,Well .. with Tata brand and Tanishq run like a corporate. At least when it comes to purity of Gold . Trust of gold is pivotal..I think that‚Äôs where Tanishq scores. Gold trust,
6363,urLoa8PkQpU,My mother visited tanisq but didn&#39;t buy anything instead bought from a local jeweler,
6364,urLoa8PkQpU,design to h hi nhi bakwas aur boring hai unnecessary show off hai bas,
6365,urLoa8PkQpU,"Most local jewellers sell gold coins of 99.95% purity. Tanishq sells 99.99 % purity coins. For that difference, they charge Rs 5000 extra",
6366,urLoa8PkQpU,Ground reality is something different. In my town it has been closed down,
6367,urLoa8PkQpU,"Small Indian jewellers are notorious for cheating customers ,there is no guarantee to the quality of gold they sell and they are not at all reliable . Tanishq did a huge favour to consumers",
6368,urLoa8PkQpU,Kyun sirf Tanishq hi reliance jo gali gali rashan de rahe h dmart bhi,
6369,urLoa8PkQpU,"Not at all Tata is still a underdog in jewellery business. The big players are kerala based jewellers like Kalyan ,Malabar, joy allukas ,josco and many more.",
6370,urLoa8PkQpU,Stupid video..it is local gold traders who get more business because of trust..big brands like this are good in advertisement and they get only upmarket clients who are not even 0.001% of population,
6371,urLoa8PkQpU,If you were Tanisqe jewellery you don&#39;t have to wear sarees pallu just show off everything if u wear Tanishq brand.<br>We Indian love other Indian jewelry. We hate deshdhrohi padukon.,
6372,urLoa8PkQpU,Never forget VARDMAN jwellers. Analysis is necessary and u are lacking in that,
6373,urLoa8PkQpU,described nicely,
6374,urLoa8PkQpU,My family still goes to family jewellers not these big corporations,
6375,urLoa8PkQpU,HI EVERYBODY...,
6376,urLoa8PkQpU,"No, it&#39;s not true",
6377,urLoa8PkQpU,"Ghanta!! Tanishq has 2 store near my house and I have never witnessed rush over there, other brands like Lalitha, GRT, Malabar are doing much much better then them.",
6378,urLoa8PkQpU,In Chennai local GRT brand that runs for now around 70 years is far more better than Titan,
6379,urLoa8PkQpU,Not a good decision to go for gold ornaments there ! Huge disappoint! Switched back to known local manufacturers,
6380,urLoa8PkQpU,"Really surprise to see this video. Tanishq has not even captured total 5% of jwelly market and it 95% is still owned by small jwellers, Get your fact corrected.",
6381,urLoa8PkQpU,I guess this video is a little too outdated as the gov itself has took very good steps like hallmarking to improvise trust in the local jeweler rather than brands. Bcoz branding is causing waisting peoples money which could indeed be used to buy more gold. Secondly daimond is not what indians want to buy you should do a little more research. And be careful something big will come in a year or two which will empower the local jewels more over these brands with a more market trust and very big competition for all such brandsüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ,
6382,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq didn‚Äôt kill anythingüòÇüòÇüòÇ gold prices have decreased sale,
6383,urLoa8PkQpU,"Lol.. I am amazed you are not worried by entire economy being killed by two business houses! And if you will bother to check Tanishq prices, you will realise that not more than 1% Indian population can afford Tanishq products.",
6384,urLoa8PkQpU,Far Fetched.,
6385,urLoa8PkQpU,Local jewellers are far better in every expects.. the after sale service they only give us. If you purchase something from tanishq and after 1 month it got damaged then they will suggest you to exchange the product and pay making charges of the new product..<br> Isse chutiya banana nhi kahenge to kya kahenge.. vo us fact ko customer ko nhi samjhynge ki aap exchange karte hai to ek to purane wale saman ka making charges+ GST loss jayega aur new saman jo lenge usme fir se making charges aur GST lagega.. vo aisa gol gol samjhynge hame ki sir aapka koi deduction thori kia ja rha hai bas making charges lagenge aur exchange ho jayega....<br>  Wahin local jwellers bahut jyada damaged jwellery ko bhi repair karwa dete hai aur suggest karte hai ki jitna din aur pahan sakti hn pahan lijiye kuki nuksan to hona hi hai making charges ka abhi karo ya baad me...<br>Tanishq sirf kisi tarah meetha meetha bol kar lootna jaanta hai,
6386,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq kuch nahi kar raha local jewellery wale lootere hote hai Jyadatar.. dang se chek Karo to bilkul Sona nahi nikalta unki jewellery me..,
6387,urLoa8PkQpU,"Well BHIMA is still number 1 in kerala, i don&#39;t think thanishq is in top 3 or 5",
6388,urLoa8PkQpU,Tatika padukone,
6389,urLoa8PkQpU,Don&#39;t make false statements. Your analysis is wrong. Skilled working small jewelry shops are ever green and dependable. Bharath people will prefer small jewelry shops rather than corporate ones. So work out on a topic deeply and then make analysis...,
6390,urLoa8PkQpU,"In kerala atleast we have ton of brands like Kalyan, Bhima, Joy Alukkas, Malabar gold , Josco and many others. Tanishq will be the last in line if none of the above shops are open on a holidayüòÇüòÇ. Their making charges are ridiculous.",
6391,urLoa8PkQpU,Seriously cause of that purity meter &amp; gold harvest scheme now I only buy gold from Tanishq brand...he pointed out the same thing...very well researched kudos to you &amp; your channel üòç‚ù§Ô∏è,
6392,urLoa8PkQpU,Buy a hallmarked jwellery from your local trusted jwellers...now a days it&#39;s not easy to cheat if you are aware of the norms..... Branded showrooms have v higher making charges and other charges...,
6393,urLoa8PkQpU,Khazana and lalitha is not charging wastage,
6394,urLoa8PkQpU,Their commercials are disappointing. They are trying to woo A small set of customer group ignoring large. Well it is just matter of few days to complete rejection. This business is much different than other tata brands. Stands out clearly for trying to be woke,
6395,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq not good,
6396,urLoa8PkQpU,Only on Purity Tanisq is assured compared to others. Others are saying 22  karat but purity is not maintained so.,
6397,urLoa8PkQpU,Tanishq is bad,
6398,urLoa8PkQpU,"you need a gold shop in every major town in jalgaon, maharastra because we have a ritual during marriage that we collect the gods (gold sheets with kul dev engraved on it) and polish them and then the Devatas participate in the marriage",
6399,urLoa8PkQpU,"Local owners used to cheat a lot, they will charge for 22k but when we went to tanishq and senco both said only 18k... So it&#39;s breach of trust",

6630,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"False information, I remember going to Haldiram when I was a kid in year 1987-88 with my family at Chandni Chowk, and according to you in 1990 Haldiram was just 11 years old and working at a bhujia shop. So how can it possible that a big shop in prime location like Chandni Chowk named after that 11 years old?  Even on their website it mentioned 1937 as the founded year.",

6642,Z7P-t_yc8gE,"Haldiram despite selling pricy products uses Palm oil which comes from destroying rainforests in Malaysia. It also uses cotton seed oil which in turn is GM seed oil as 95% of the cotton grown in India is GM. Its packged products has quite good number of flavouring agents, colouring agents and chemicals many of which are carcinogenic and banned in EU. They also generate copious amount  of plastic waste. My two cents - buy local, package free or make it at home.",

Swamiji comes to know of Jamshetji being onboard and meets him. After they get to know each other, Swamiji suggests to Jamshetji to start a company that is into research and development apart from the companies he already had. Swamiji says this research will help India in the long run. They soon reach their ports of departure.

6900,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Thanks!,
6901,B_AY4a3_-GQ,RuPay is great so proud india has it but it still has lot of little issues while making payments very soon it will dominate visa and Mastercard infact its already almost there. i still prefer visa for the reliability and no glitches. i used Rupay for first time in india just few weeks ago and it was working well 95% of the time and the banks are also pushing Rupay cards and visa cards take you upto a month or more to receive if you apply for it from your bank which is a good initiative.  India is going to dominate the world in a few years.,
6902,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Very informative.,
6903,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"When i started watching this video I too was mesmerize as this being a masterstroke until <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_AY4a3_-GQ&amp;t=10m18s"">10:18</a> my perception changed, The gov want to take control of the unorganized sector and hence giving rewadi we all know what this gov did to the LPG cylinder and petrol/diesel. The purpose is to start taxing the unorganised sector later this is the sole mindset. India has been able to bounce back from most recession because of this unorganized sector as it remained uncontrolled and there was no burden on these ppl towards loan repayment, cars, buy luxury items etc. What the Rupay card will do is push them into debit in the long run while the gov will keep collecting tax. No doubt we do need a rival to Visa/Mastercard but all are evil. While Visa/Mastercard collect revenue from foreigners, Rupay is building castles ripping its own ppl how fair is that.",
6904,B_AY4a3_-GQ,A very visionary step by the great Manmohan singhji... this is what happens when a learned fellow is at the helm.,
6905,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Can we get rupay cards from banks like icici and HDFC,
6906,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Let&#39;s convert our visa debit credit cards to Rupay.. let&#39;s contribute in nations growth üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥üáÆüá≥ i love my India,

Chinese internal payment network was established in 2002.",
6908,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"Watching YouTube videos, I have taken a PNB Rupay Credit Card &amp; attached with my BHIM account. Finally, I found out UPI+Credit Card payment is not accepted at any regular shops.

6909,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Superb .Very well explained. Useful.,
6910,B_AY4a3_-GQ,If this was congress they would have made a facility such that only American companies can provide cards to indian and make the american company donate to CONGRESS PARTY funds and the khan family will enrich themselves. On the other hand Modi goverment has done wonders for indian people.,

6915,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"Very well explained... More I&#39;m watching your videos, more I like your unbiased crystal clear analysis",
6916,B_AY4a3_-GQ,The process seems to be slightly incorrect. The card network sends back the approved or rejected code to the acquiring bank and not to the payment gateway.,
6917,B_AY4a3_-GQ,I like Govt doing good things but killing private business is bad.  We all know how govt services work in India.,
6918,B_AY4a3_-GQ,All credits goes to Prime minister Modi,

6924,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Good for India!!!,
6925,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Netflix  does not accept  rupay. <br>Horrible,
6926,B_AY4a3_-GQ,why are you showing N.Modi and co. Rupay was conceived and launched NPCI on 26 march 2012.,
6927,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Amazing video,

6929,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"The problem and risk can be reduced by putting a limit - say - Up to Rs. 500 (or Rs. 1,000) there is no transaction fee. Any additional amount spend will have a fee of 1% of the over and above amount.<br>For a Rs. 2,000 purchase, fee is changed for Rs. 1,000<br><br>If this policy is interdicted, there will be huge profit generated and that profit can be used to help the poor!!",

6938,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Great vision of NPCI and BJP. Keep up the good work.,
6939,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Now Pak govt is copying Rupay but without UPI system.,
6940,B_AY4a3_-GQ,people need to realize the more people that have bank accounts-its easier for the govt to track and tax them evetually,
6941,B_AY4a3_-GQ,links are bullshit coudln&#39;t even  get a  rupay creditcard,

6944,B_AY4a3_-GQ,people got bank account hoping fake puts 15 lakhs to their account,
6945,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Rupay is useless however UPI is great.,
6946,B_AY4a3_-GQ,That&#39;s the use of Rupay card? It&#39;s not international and only works in India. <br>Visa and Mastercard are international and it works in any websites.,
6947,B_AY4a3_-GQ,That&#39;s why Modi said he will share 15 lakhs rupees to each Indians... so that new bank accounts can open,
6948,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Kudos to the Indian govt. for this initiative. At times like this we all have seen the importance of self reliance. I just hope that all necessary measures are taken to fill up the lackings and this initiative succeeds because then India will gain a big upper hand in the financial sector of the world.,
6949,B_AY4a3_-GQ,public sector banks like the SBI are not promoting GOI interests or national interests,

6986,B_AY4a3_-GQ,Had goosebumps from amazement and pride. Vande Mataram.,
6987,B_AY4a3_-GQ,"You totally missed the point of visa and master card.  These cards are primarily credit cards and make their money through 20% interest on short term loans. Debit cards are a tiny portion of their business.  Rupay has no credit facility to encourage short term loans.  Since rupay is now free all the Indian suppliers are being squeezed out, with Paytm barely surviving, while large us conglomerates like Phone Pe (walmart), Amazon pay, Google pay etc grabbing a bigger percentage of the transactions.  Without a financial incentive nobody can develop these services.  Indian banks have totally ignored app based payments and barely add it to their bank app",
6988,B_AY4a3_-GQ,It‚Äôs definitely a well thought out and structured approach to financial inclusion and independence. And the model will be sustainable at nominal mdr rates with scale and higher penetration of small ticket short term loans to merchants. With both UPI and Rupay going international these rail roads will also bring in much needed FX income to India while ensuring our data localization.,

7012,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Now as Nykaa has raised, it has started fooling customers like most of other ecom sites. They delete negative reviews and most of the reviews are fake. You cannot trust their product ratings AT ALL.",
7013,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa is winning because almost everyone on insta wants to be a makeup artist or beauty influencer. Makeup artists charge 40k per hour and do 2 to 5 clients per day. And they claim they use international brands but use shid products like PAC. There used to makeup videos for free on YouTube few years back but now everyone sells courses and workshops.

7020,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa is just another fraudster company that&#39;s all. On top of that they charge more money on products which can be bought at cheaper rate at other online store or on shops.,
7021,TCboTQr8Ecg,More profit more tax,
7022,TCboTQr8Ecg,Bcoz the founder is an MBA in finance and a ca so focus was always on finance and profitability,

7024,TCboTQr8Ecg,Flipkart is not indian company...WTFü§îü§î,
7025,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Just wanted to say in inventory model the e-commerce portal bleed like anything in terms of margins,  where they make a very little of profit compared to Marketplace model as the due to liability of Inventory and outright payments.

7041,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nyka sells original that&#39;s why it buys directly from brands.,
7042,TCboTQr8Ecg,My doubt is...so why cant Amazon India or Flipkart India both register subsidiaries or a cloud tail a vendor owned by Amazon but can be owned by an Indian do what Nykaa is doing?,

7046,TCboTQr8Ecg,Damn good,
7047,TCboTQr8Ecg,Like you mentioned the inventory model can&#39;t be carried out by foreign players so amazon can&#39;t do but what about flipkart ?,

7049,TCboTQr8Ecg,Make video on hyperlocal marketplace and whats gone wrong with local baniya amd paper tape and how to solve that.,
7050,TCboTQr8Ecg,Dude please get your facts right.,
7051,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Nykaa USP which I feel as a buyer: better transperancy of brands, better transperancy of products (it shows all shades of foundation for example, so you know which shades will suit you: it allows to see how foundation will look on different skin colour with a picture), clear instruction on how to use the product, expiry dates and ingredients also. And last but not the least, their packaging is top class, it makes the buyers feel that Nykaa has made sure that products reach with minimal or no damage. It gives a sense of value, care which the customers have placed on the products.",
7052,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nykaa has been reported of selling counterfeit impoted products and also withdrawing delivery services from several previously deliverable locations. Still people continue to shop at nykaa because of the perception that it has a higher standard to competing e-commerce retailers,
7053,TCboTQr8Ecg,please make a video on  Amaraja battery also On Bitcoin Crypto  risk rating and usage,
7054,TCboTQr8Ecg,"Just wanted to add a few points here and there, the horrible in-store Nykaa experience is a real thing. Sephora hires way more experienced people; Nykaa, especially in tier 2 and 3 cities, lacks on that aspect. And that remains a market to be tapped. However, one thing that worked with Nykaa&#39;s own ranges has been its community and their intensive market research. The shade range that they offer is exceptional for brown skin-tones. Brands like MAC which operate across the world and cater to all skin shades are pricier, and in the section that is experimenting with, or exploring makeup, a good below 500 product is amazing. <br>Oh and they have an entire section of website only for makeup artists, specific offers and product ranges.",
7055,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nyka is the Sephora of India,
7056,TCboTQr8Ecg,Nyka also sends duplicate products. And also half empty ones,

7058,TCboTQr8Ecg,Beauty products themself are nonsense products. Day by day people will stop using these products.,
7059,TCboTQr8Ecg,I think soon nyaka will be swallowed by Amazon or flipkart. No unique value except inventory model. Fake products and customer awareness soon will be addressed by Amazon.,

7066,TCboTQr8Ecg,I love nykaa stores. They leave their products open and let the customer choose and check those by their own. It&#39;s very much comfortable. We get to choose what we want without having the seller pressure. And that&#39;s how we ended up buying what i really want not what the seller want us to buy.,

7142,H3Z7bFXfMAU,"This is a typical Hindutva piece of propaganda. Never ever expect an orthodox Hindu to be able to represent the truth. The truth is that even the Tamils that were approved for citizenship are descendants of the very powerful south Indian empires that continuously led violent invasions into Sri Lanka for centuries. Each time as they invaded their first action was to impose Hinduism and the abominable caste system, and each time small Sinhalese armies managed to defeat them at the end and reclaim their country back. Whatever so called discrimination the Tamils have experienced within the last two centuries is due to the fact that they later cited with every European invading force so that they could rule over the Sinhalese. For example, when the British came the Tamils were favored as a tactic that the British always used. The British would always use a minority to rule a majority and in this case it was the Tamils and a new class of Christian they had also created. The British gave a lot of power to the Tamils which they used in turn to vent their hatred against the Sinhalese. These things were never mentioned by this ultraorthodox Hindu host. Last but not least, despite all these economic problems the average income and quality of life of the Sri Lankan people have always been higher than that of Indians. This was even reluctantly mentioned by a few Indian hosts in other programs. Also, discrimination has always been lower in Sri Lanka due to the fact that Buddhists do not put people in water-tight compartments called castes. Women have always enjoyed more rights and there was never widow burning among the Sinhalese. Every abominable cultural practice that came from India was confronted despite overwhelming odds. The Tamils have a lot of fantastic claims that even the British denied as factual. Ultimately, it is not the fault of Tamils either and that is because the Brahmins control their minds and religion. It is because of them that Hindu shastras consider Buddhist as polluting by touch and culture. Hindu scriptures such as many puranas clearly forbid Hindus to have contact with Buddhists or those who follow a different path. The Sinhalese have never considered Hindus as impure or ill omen despite all their violence. Remember, Hinduism is the only religion that treats a fourth of their own supposed followers as untouchable. It is the only religion that kills members of their own religion on a daily basis for being impure. Now, if they treat their own people like that you can only understand the cruelty that was forced upon the Sinhalese each time they invaded centuries ago. Still though, I have no hatred towards Tamils because I know for a fact that the majority of them are good people and I wish them a happy future and success in life. Best wishes and may the Sri Lankan people succeed in creating a better future than the one that was forced on them by a group of criminal internationals.",

But this entrapment is not some fine print in the contract, the terms of the deal is in the open and there for everyone to see!

7175,H3Z7bFXfMAU,"If someone tells you that China is engaging in debt diplomacy or that China is enslaving the developing world with the so-called debt trap, don‚Äôt let them fool you. For instance, they may claim China is the biggest lender to Sri Lanka but the truth is western lenders are the biggest lenders, whose aggregate debt is over 4x of that of China.<br><br>Here are the key facts to consider when analyzing the current debt crisis in Sri Lanka, and for that matter, similar events in developing countries in general.<br><br>Q1 - Is China the biggest lender to Sri Lanka. Answer - no, 47% of its foreign debts are in form of Eurobonds and many of these are Western Institutional Investors such as UBS, JP Morgan, Blackrock, etc. Outside of this category, ADB is the single largest lender at 13%, followed by China and Japan, each at 10% apiece, and then World Bank at 9%. In other words, saying China is exploiting Sri Lanka through a ‚Äòdebt trap‚Äô is completely false, or misleading at best. <br><br>Q2 - Is China causing the debt crisis in Sri Lanka or is it helping to address such debt crisis. Perhaps we can use the Hambantota Port to illustrate this as it is often cited as the exemplary debt trap case or China involved in predatory lending. Sri Lanka‚Äôs bloating foreign debt problem already appeared in the 2010s. In 2017, China (through Export &amp; Import Bank of China, China Development Bank) was called in to refinance its previous debts to Sri Lanka as well as facilitate the latter in servicing other foreign debt payments. A JV between Sri Lanka‚Äôs state-owned Port Authority and China Merchant Bank was formed in 2017 to run the said 99-year lease of Hambantota Port requiring China‚Äôs side to provide new USD900 million funds. Without which (ie the emergency funding), the country would have faced serious debt distress. In other words, this port-lease / emergency fund was not causing the country‚Äôs debt issue, but rather alleviating it.<br><br>Q3 - When these developing countries can‚Äôt keep up the debt payments, what would China normally do? As a matter of fact, China has assisted these countries by debt cancellation and debt restructuring (including reliefs such as extending maturity, interest rate reductions, refinancing, and extensions). Beneficiary countries include African countries as well as countries covered by the Belt and Road Initiative (see D. Brautigam‚Äôs clip for details).<br><br>Q4 - Where did the borrowed money go? Let&#39;s again use the Sri Lanka case. The foreign debt is being spent on infrastructures - in this case, Hambantota Port. As with all infrastructure investments, such spending enhances the future productivity and living standards of its nationals. Meantime, such spending also aids domestic employment. Most importantly, the money trails can be easily tracked and traced (for instance, railways or power plants). On the contrary, funds provided by the Eurobond Market have been mostly applied to cover the country&#39;s trade deficit and to meet fiscal deficits. In some developing countries where corruptions are prevalent, some of these funds may be misappropriated, ending in the pockets of its political leaders and oligarchs.<br><br>Q5 - What is the impact of rising international interest rates on Sri Lanka‚Äôs foreign debt? Interest rates hiking means that the refinancing costs of Sri Lanka&#39;s foreign debts will be on the rise, making its dire financial situation even worse. Worse still, Sri Lanka is importing inflation as its currency devaluates (on the contrary, USD appreciates with rising interest rates). Foreign goods, as well as commodities like oil and gas, are made more expensive, resulting in acute food and energy shortages.<br><br>In conclusion, the debt trap is not caused by China, but rather by western lenders. They are making it worse for Sri Lanka as these Western Countries are raising interest rates, making it more difficult for the country to service its interest payments and refinance maturing debts.<br><br>Deborah Brautigam, a well-known scholar, has covered China ‚Äôs ‚Äòdebt trap‚Äô myth extensively. She specifically addressed the Sri Lanka case in her clip (see the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3Z7bFXfMAU&amp;t=15m20s"">15:20</a> mark onward). <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5SvFjlu9ZM"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5SvFjlu9ZM</a>",

7231,JkIxbnhMrTw,Mozilla didn&#39;t put the needs of their users first. They put their philosophy first and it cost them their users.,
7232,JkIxbnhMrTw,It&#39;s about time. We need a video on Brave Browser.,
7233,JkIxbnhMrTw,"even now firefox exist , and its lighter and faster than chrome, mozilla will stay and work as long as open source exists",

7253,JkIxbnhMrTw,I personally prefer Firefox as it‚Äôs more secure and private. Firefox is a default browser in Linux OS. Firefox entry into VPN is delayed but Firefox is customisable so most closed or embedded devices use it. <br><br>Firefox back end code is used in multiple devices. If Firefox starts changing. It will end up like Java when Oracle took over. <br><br>The best approach for Firefox would be charge for integration to IOT devices &amp; different architecture.,
7254,JkIxbnhMrTw,Firefox founders have launched a new browser called Brave. It&#39;s very light weight as compared to other browsers and also provides automatic blocking of online advertisements and website trackers in its default settings.,

None of the advanced users cares about browser competition when they fire up a live USB stick containing the Tails OS.

In 2015, after I completed my post graduation, I needed loan to open my own clinic. The loan wasn‚Äôt so big that the Bank had to fear a default, around 12 lacs! <br>Now I was a fresh pass out from my residency. I had no income tax history. The Banks like SBI advertised that for doctor they are providing doctors loan of Rs 35 lacs without any collateral guarantee!! Now when I went to the Bank, I did all my paper work, submitted everything that was required . The banks never called me back on their own. For next 12 months I kept going to bank visiting the bank manager, who kept giving excuses that it‚Äôs stuck in higher center, sometimes they would say one more document is required which the forgot ‚Ä¶ now in the meanwhile one of their criteria for loan was that I should have a valid rent agreement for my clinic premises. Now I had rented a place for the clinic for that purpose. Now imaging for next 12 months I did not get the loan to start the clinic. But I paid monthly rent of the space without generating any income!! . So I paid rent for 12 months. After more than 12 months. I filed my first income tax file. When I submitted that. Only then My loan was granted!! So you see, even though the advertisement we‚Äôre given for loan without any income proof, but the final decision lies on the branch manager. If one does not the branch manager well, or branch manager does not have confidence in you, you will not get the loan. Now after 8 years of practice, the bank managers keep calling me or come physically to my clinic asking me if I have any requirements. The fact that I am a safe client, they are now more than willing!!! This is the story of Indian Banking system!!! It caters to those who have money and want to earn more money!!!

( I think only students credit card scheme is not popular otherwise all other schemes are promoting and adopting by people quickly) sometimes we need money not for only small education expenses or agriculture expense or small health expenses but in home other works also which are not specify and we don&#39;t have small loan for these otherwise from education to agriculture to health to buisness government is giving credit card for small loans to big big loans also so indian government is doing well than expected very well",

The real situation is however, very different. <br>First the country has to be seen at two layers of urban and rural India, because I do not think the situations faced by residents in either are similar. Then there are layers in both of India&#39;s, layers of poverty and mind that both India would have substantially different layers as the living expenses and potential opportunities are different. <br>Using this as a base, maybe you guys should do this video again. I wish ending poverty was this easy but in the end, it&#39;s all about creating opportunities for people to develop into. As an example, this ITI trainings started by predecessor govt, were amazing tools for people to acquire skills.

You let them use the services to get home book flights back to Delhi.but when time to come back sell their seat to someone else with more cash. Strand them in an air port to fend for themselves. How is that good business. If you don&#39;t take care of you employees why should they give their all back to a company where money is more important the their employees security? Right now Indigo Air is the last air line I would trust with my safety. I&#39; d pay a bit more to the competition if they guarantee my safety and that of their air and ground crews,

7915,7QOLDRY_Uk4,Almost every US domestic airlines never give food on the flight. They only provide little leg space and no entertainment. The ticket price remains between 80-120 USD.

7916,7QOLDRY_Uk4,I have heard that Indigo employs female flight crew as opposed to male crew which brings down the weight of the flight by atleast 50 kgs. Saves fuel in the long run. Also the crew collects the trash even before the plane touches down leading to faster turn around...,

So the Manpower Cost for a  Europe or America based carrier is far more than the Carriers based in India.  But, still while Airlines in India have mounting losses, the European and North American airlines are either breaking even or making a Profit.

Jet had A330 and 777 as their widebody long hauls, Kingfisher had Vistara has 737 and 320s in its fleet.

That&#39;s a good way as well to promote along with dealerships. <br>Computerisation as a symbol of modern production is must and it tells in the way profits grow. <br>Employee culture and internal communication is vital which Corporate Governance practices proved. <br>As such we can learn that decentralisation and no intervention in internal management can take a company to heights.  <br>Finally Asian as a brand name has a ring to it. It stands for some values along with ushering good qualities in anew year,  festivals etc., <br>Tough market but branding by association has done marvel to the entity. <br>Way to go.

And to make it a player in the market for both providing affordable services and getting profits. <br>Instead of making a best one the government had made its own company a failed and miserable one now and making the private owned companies to top.<br>The answer to the thumbnail is here &quot;The government killed its own BSNL&quot;,

8114,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Photos of Murasoli Maran and D.Raja (the then telecom ministers) should have been made part of thumbnail of the video rather than the photos of  Mukesh Ambani and Narendra Modi. One of the many reasons of failure of BSNL is bad customer behaviour by their staff. BSNL is good for rural areas only to provide connectivity to the rural citizens.,
8115,Wlgk8XXHWuA,The pic u have put up is wrong.  There may have been conniving  but efficiency is also important.  BSNL was killed in the year 1995 2000 during congress regime,
8116,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Bro why do you think Govt still keeps this worst company alive? They aren&#39;t changing to young management,  they aren&#39;t changing to high quality equipments, there are many money stealing middle men&#39;s..<br><br>Is it cheap for govt to use specialised bsnl for them on people&#39;s tax money?",

8123,Wlgk8XXHWuA,I would think the main reason is the way BSNL employees behave. Just because of their job security they won&#39;t even answer an enquiry from customer.<br>On other hand even though private networks are costly service is provided in a very gud way. I think this the main reason why people chose other networks over BSNL,
8124,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL has given me the worst services for long.. &amp; all my friends relatives who had BSNL say the same thing,

THIS WAS A REVENUE SHARE ARRANGEMENT WITH INVESTMENT FROM US.<br>SO sad to see the efforts thrashed by these power hungry corrupt politicians. ‚Äú DATA ONE‚Äù WAS THE BRANDING DEVELOPED WITH US. <br>PLEASE DO GET IN TOUCH IF YOU WISH TO KNOW MORE.",
8153,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Customer support was worst,
8154,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"I&#39;m using BSNL since maybe 5 yaers, recently I got 4g sim but work 3g everywhere, but then too BSNL 3g runs like other 4gs and is more consistent that other companies",
8155,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL killed itself much before JIO was born. I myself paid for defunct landline  and broad-band connection for 2 year without being able to use it at all. Also they did not refund the caution deposited. Most of their customers left them.,
8156,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Koi bsnl ko bandh krne ki koshish kub kar. Sakta hai ye socha hai ?  Because of union dadagiri, employ is not wiling to serve people, sarkari babugiri ka behaviour, or bhi reason hai but ye main hai, apko pata hai Ahmedabad ki mills bandh hone ka main Karan majur Mahajan tha. Kyuki jab union only thought about amploye(chori karta pkda gya worker union ki help se vapis aa jata tha ) and not thinking about owner benifit  so finally all mills slowly gradualy close.",
8157,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Why was 4G not alloted to bsnl? <br><br>How is the so called`2G scam&#39; related to BSNL&#39;s fall?<br><br>Why did the supreme court acquit those accused in 2Gscam?<br><br>And finally,<br>Are you running &#39;think school&#39; or &#39;propaganda school&#39;?",
8158,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Done mislead with Modi‚Äôs picture. As per your own video BSNL started descending irrecoverably way before Modi came to power.,
8159,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL employees spend more time in their homes than at their job. If you take home big payments and other government benefits but do not deserve it then you are bound to be thrashed.,
8160,Wlgk8XXHWuA,It&#39;s not government problem. Employees not working proper that was reason. üëç,
8161,Wlgk8XXHWuA,There is no way a govt org can do business. Govt job to create regulatory authority and form rules.,
8162,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL is not failed. but Govt made them failed,
8163,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Modi haters opening video after watching thumbnail and getting nailed by think school üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,
8164,Wlgk8XXHWuA,I&#39;ve not seen a better channel than this.. people like Think School should be rewarded heavily for bringing such insanely valuable information into the public domain which our Education system couldn&#39;t,
8165,Wlgk8XXHWuA,I info here is not full or no full picture. BSNL had biggest network in India but its network was never update to full potential here refering to last 40-50 yr. We were almost last to update internet speed till 2000 when one pvt news channels had highest net speed more than PMO exposed via RTI application.All thanks to then govt IT minister who worked out deal in their favour whitout knowing PMO.  For info govt records govt still hold fastest net speed including satellite internet speed.,
8166,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Besides all bullshits i disliked bsnl of their poor customer service,
8167,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL was a crappy company. During the time you said BSNL made profits I used to be a child and I joked with my friends that BSNL means &#39;Bhai Sahabh Nahi Lagega&#39;!<br>Customers will naturally gravitate towards a company that values them.,
8168,Wlgk8XXHWuA,India is a wonderful land but people&#39;mindset is worst!,
8169,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"BSNL was one of India&#39;s best networks until the privatization era came in. One of the reasons of BSNL&#39;s downfall is JIO Industry and JIO&#39;s Political Connections. As of today, JIO Plan prices are more expensive than any of it&#39;s competitors and BSNL Plan costs half the price of JIO&#39;s.<br><br>(Ignore any grammatical mistakes)",
8170,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Everything about BSNL was hunky dory. It&#39;s true our polical will to promote few private players to gain money power led to downfall. It&#39;s service connectivity etc of course gone bad. If govt not hire engineers, customer care staff and finally good leaders for BSNL, how we can expect. Now we can abuse n discard BSNL.But remember our privacy is now in the hands of few corporates n the infrastructure used by them in remote villages is made out of public money. But still we say Jio ki Jay...sad",
8171,Wlgk8XXHWuA,I do not like this crony capitalist policy by Modi Govt... India as a country should grow and be prosperous not just a few businessmen... This is dangerous for our nation,
8172,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Not only BSNL this government is killing all public sector companies. this is our poor condition that we can&#39;t appose this and we must say this is a great government,
8173,Wlgk8XXHWuA,As a customer no one will go for a company........Where Employees are not respected......<br>The Airtel is growing...just due to the fact that...their customer services are excellent......,
8174,Wlgk8XXHWuA,No one killed  BSNL. It committed suicide .,
8175,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"very good content, but the thumbnail should have shown the actual culprits!",
8176,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"whenever i visited BSNL office i cursed them whole-heartedly, looking at their casual attitude and their poor cust service.  This was bound to happen and every other govt organization should learn from their mistake",
8177,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL WAS KILLED BY THE  COMMUNIST UNIONS.,
8178,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Another sad story of Government in business. Ministers lacking integrity and business skills.,
8179,Wlgk8XXHWuA,What&#39;s the blueprint does Modi Govt. have. for the turn around of BSNL . I&#39;m really worried that till today I am sticking with BSNL. Never tried other operators &amp; I&#39;ve no complaints about the internet service though I&#39;m residing in a metropolitan city.,
8180,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bharatmatakijay"">#BHARATMATAKIJAY</a>",
8181,Wlgk8XXHWuA,And you know the funny part I m watching this vdo over bsnl internet service ü§£ü§£,
8182,Wlgk8XXHWuA,I think you are biased....<br>I disliked.,
8183,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Rightly said... something are not about profit.,
8184,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlgk8XXHWuA&amp;t=2m30s"">2:30</a> Most people just look at money and does know anything else, this is true for all govt institutions like metro, and it is true for all countries",
8185,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Hey this is misleading information. <br>What current government done for BSNL for the past 8 years ?<br>BSNL for sale ?<br>Do you know Airtel is profit making company than JIO ?<br>Please don&#39;t inject wrong information to the public.,
8186,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"Politicians and their corruption is pulling the country down. If corruption remains unchecked and guilty not punished, it will destroy our country. Courts should act fast to punish the guilty and put them behind bars. Enforce the fear of law in the guilty minds.",
8187,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"It&#39;s the inefficiency of BSNL and the lethargic attitude of the staff and not being competitive is what brought down BSNL... , If others can pay and buy the licence from BSNL run an enterprise effectively then why can&#39;t BSNL... They are solely responsible for it&#39;s demise !!!",
8188,Wlgk8XXHWuA,From the last time I heard govt sanctions thousand of crores for revival of BSNL and MTNL .. so how‚Äôs it get killed ??,
8189,Wlgk8XXHWuA,real truth is corruption is everywhere...wen government wants something then they bring it ..why nobody is taking about 5g scam ?<br><br>if u dont know the issue in  2g was it sold at high price which is 2g scam...where as 5g spectrum is sold much less than 2g ....<br><br>now loan waivers to huge private companies is disastrous than these corruption.,
8190,Wlgk8XXHWuA,&quot;I think their top level management team is the only culprits for the collapse of this company and moreover some of the trade unions especially from the southern states specially from Kerala is also equally responsible for the drowning of BSNL&quot;.,
8191,Wlgk8XXHWuA,bsnl staff killed bsnl. prime example of how corrupt people can sink a revenue generating organisation,
8192,Wlgk8XXHWuA,"BSNL should focus on giving fibre connectivity and Enterprise business, it should give up mobile communication since it might not be very lucrative as the cost of operation is too much and already there is a saturation of mobile density. As the technology in mobile communication is changing rapidly investing for the new generation is mere waste of money",
8193,Wlgk8XXHWuA,modi killed bsnl,
8194,Wlgk8XXHWuA,When u cut the staff then they can&#39;t give service..and when political leaders take decision on their benefits then good government company making losses,
8195,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Bro make video on airtel data and calling charges.,
8196,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Government delayed from giving getting 4G spectrum. My father works in bsnl office since 2000. After india china war in 2019-2020 goverment boycott china goods that&#39;s why bsnl not get 4G spectrum and but now private companies getting the 5G spectrum from china and government don&#39;t give permission in auction of 5G spectrum for bsnl.ü•≤ü§ß,
8197,Wlgk8XXHWuA,These are the case study why India Is going towards privatization.<br>1. once people get govt job they stop working<br>2. quota system: beurocracy above meritocracy <br>3. Corruption : 2004 -2014 - Intentionally govt weakened bsnl position,
8198,Wlgk8XXHWuA,Now bsnl is being killed to increase market share of jio. Bsnl does not have funds to run their towers. The fake 2g case was used by Ambani to kill bsnl,
8199,Wlgk8XXHWuA,BSNL service was trash from the beginning. BSNL is like SBI of Network connections.,

8321,FPj5gTT4j_A,This guy lacks common sense. When your currency is strong you can afford to devalue is purposely. But if you already have a weak currency you can&#39;t afford to just to make few parameters good on papers. Low currency value is a disaster for long term. Most of G20 economies have stronger currency.,

8329,FPj5gTT4j_A,India government need to be efficiently-responsible and most of their people need to cooperate with them,
8330,FPj5gTT4j_A,"another thing to consider is that we have lots of problems when we want to setup a business, the ease of doing business is very low in India while in countries like Singapore, that was corrected and that&#39;s why they grew so much because it was easier to conduct business meetings and all there",
8331,FPj5gTT4j_A,The claim that countries devalue their currencies to boost exports is complete BS. Would you rather hold the more valuable currency and buy crap with it or export a lot of goods and services for the same currency you printed and let loose?<br><br>Of course most countries are doing the second - they can print money and fool the domestic population and then make them believe their services are not worth much.,

8342,FPj5gTT4j_A,"Devaluation of Indian currency to boost exports is a misnomer. Made in India,  skill India,  msme policies need to perform consistently so as to boost exports. <br>While productivity is not scaling on par with China or world economy,  devaluation of currency will only increase prices and less consumption. <br>Currency depreciation is a serious issue as it shows the purchasing capacity of rupees is lesser. <br>How to solve the issue. It should be a temporary measure and other economic conditions need to be set right. <br>Indian rupees is not a dominant player in the market andto boost it&#39;s value,  the country has to produce more,  supply more and consume more. <br>Import substitution has not worked either as we lack raw materials and import bill piles up just to stay at a certain growing rate. <br>While being abroad I realise the power of currency and for India to compete in the world market,  it needs to strengthen the purcashing power of it. <br>And that is to improve our GDP and cut cost of production so as to match Euro or dollar in future.",

8393,FPj5gTT4j_A,"Devaluing Indian currency is an absolute  no no. Simply because the import cost of oil will go up. Especially in this scenario when the oil prices are going up all the reserve money with India is being channelised to fund the Import  of oil. At the same time India is not adopting EVs. blindly following the advice of Maruti and Toyota. ICEs should banned , rather discouraged by high taxes which should be used to subsidise EVs.  EVs may be  running on coal-fired electricity but that will stem the trade deficit caused by import of oil. Logic is very simple ; India‚Äôs growth is inversely proportional to the cost of oil.

NEVER BELIEVE THAT BLINDLY, have your own micro research and develop an individual notion and not try to impose it on others cuz that&#39;s when you become toxic. Male your own approach and viewpoint and keep it to urself and try to just explain it in a healthy debate among your friends, parents etc.",

But whatsapp and Facebook has a billions of users who don&#39;t understand all these technical sides and they will continue using the platform because they are used to it. People will switch from whatsapp only if there is no whatsapp and I don&#39;t think that is gonna happen anytime soon.,

In an operation theatre along with the doctors performing - this surgeon can be present as an avatar - go around 360 degrees to get the exact understanding and guide the performing doctors what need to be done.<br><br>No Technology is good or bad as per me - it&#39;s all about how we make use of it.

If thats what Indians super spy is all about we may as well hand the keys to our border to China.  Doval shows off our &quot;strategies&quot; our heavy weapons emplacements and boasts of our equipment and arms and what these are to be used for&gt; China in such circumstances do not require to spend millions on intelligence gathering. Doval is acting the same way Krishna Menon did prior to 1962. KM showed Chou En Lai where our defences were placed which made it a cake walk for Chinese troops to overrun un in 1962. IN GAlwan   Gen&gt; Naravane failed to tell us our electronic intelligence had been hacked and interdicted which gave the Chinese a huge advantage over our troops.",

8771,fnO6UfeplxE,Brilliantüëç,
8772,fnO6UfeplxE,"Any one who has achieved a top position if we look at, they reached there through their talent, handwork and feedback system they built - But, unfortunately what happens is after certain time - the feedback system doesn&#39;t work &#39;as initially - let me put my point through an example<br><br>A famous director who has given 5 block busters .. Imagine how much thought process would have gone into during story finalization, script making, shooting , post production etc., Every time while the director discusses with his feedback channel - initially there is every possibility the channel would be coming out with their views, thoughts, apprehensions towards the decisions taken etc.,<br><br>But as no one know which will work - finally they will be agreeing at some point and in that there would be enough places where they may have not felt fully convinced with the director. But, when they see those areas well accepted by audience and movies become hit one after one - the feedback channel gets to a stage knowingly or unknowingly that the director thought process is right than what they are thinking and they may not be giving feedback in the same way they used to do initially.<br><br>That&#39;s why we see successful directors, leaders, entrepreneurs do commit mistakes at their peak stager. Therefore having a feedback system and refining that every now and then is equally important. <br><br>Nice topic chosen Ganesh... Can you sometime write what inspires you to come out with such topics and how do you actually research to make such informative and engaging consent. Thanks in advance",

When USA got bankrupt  , and they dont have money or commodities.<br>So now in 2022 , bangladesh GDP will increase.

So bangladesh will give back all , when USA will goes bankrupt .<br>Bangladesh GDP will goes down like Shrilanka.

And if you dont know , if you see in news channels that india and china is fighting , but in reality india- china and Russia is now freinds from inside. They dont show freindship from inside , but they help each other when they are in emergency needs.<br>So from this new freindship bringing more wealth. And china now agree to invest in india also. <br>So thats why indian projects were handeled by chinese plants under make in india projects. This freindship , USA dont like , because of the USA is not getting commodities from the india , china and russia.<br>Thats why UK is sacrificed in this ukraine war , and USA hide his plans with UK. Now UK is under biggest economy blast. Even africa like poor countries dont want to send commodities in USA and Urope. So the whole world think that dollar can anytime crash , and stock market will fell more than 80% . And dollars will wipe out from the stock market. üòÅüòÅ<br>This is showing insecurity of the dollar , thats why whole world is now hiding their money into the safe countries like india , indonesia , bangladesh.

8918,sBBMRBVvVis,"<b>History repeating like during WW2 and WW1/Spanish plague.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now under WW3 and a corona virus pandemic. Hitler used Zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the fumant removed.  It causes symptoms like corona virus.  Look up in the sky you will see planes spraying your cities!  Hitler attacked Russia, just like what is happening now.  The British Empire had no legal male Heir so they imported a fake one from Germany.  The British Queen&#39;s husband &quot;Prince Philip&quot; renounced his German citizenship, became a Greek citizen and as a Greek citizen moved to Britain gaining citizenship there.  After gaining citizenship, he was appointed a Duke, out of thin air and then as a Prince and married Queen Elizabeth.  &quot;Prince Philip&quot; took the name of the Queen, not the other way, as it usually is done, where a wife takes the husband&#39;s name.  The British Empire has run out of male Heirs at least twice, and they kill to suppress it.    WW2 was a way of hiding this fraud, and now WW3 is a way of hiding that illegal combines Heir. The Bible says that a male would not fail to sit on the throne.  A family name continues through the males, not the females, and Philip was a fraud.  He had become a Greek citizen to make it appear that he was a Royal from the earlier Greek dynasty.</b>  Total theater.  <b>The Catholic Empires of the Roman Empire form one leg and the UK(British controlled) Empire forms the other leg of the Roman Empire, with the King Pope Francis as the ruler of the whole system.  He has a triple teired crown with 666 on it in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  He is a King of the city state of the Vatican(the Vatican is the smallest Country in the world), Rome Italy, and is mentioned in Revelation, Apocalypse, 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions that this Empire is responsible for all those slaughtered on earth.  It mention what the leaders wear, which is scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  The UK leg Royals also wear those colors, a long with Judges and Magistrates of the Crown.  They refer to this entity as the Crown.  When some one goes to court in one of the British subservient Nations, it is said that the Crown has a case against the person.</b>  Canada, Australian and others are not sovereign or free.  please read Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, and study it closely, because this Empire comes as a false system claiming to represent God, but exterminates to stay in power.  <b>1Timothy3:1-16 mentions that the one looking after a group(Church) should be a husband of one wife with obedient children.  The Pope and the Priests of the Catholic Church are forbidden to marry, and so don&#39;t even qualify, according to the very book and God they say they claim to represent(an unmarried man has no wife or children.)   The Bible&#39;s Peter&#39;s mother in-law was cured by Jesus(Yeshua).  So if Peter had a mother in law, then he had a wife as there is no other way.</b>  That is why Catholic Priest have sex with so many little boys, girls and women attendees.  <b>There was over ninety cases of Preists molesting little boys in the city of Boston, USA alone.  None of the Priests were disciplined, but were only moved to a different location, and now you know why.  The whole system is a fraud.</b>  So this organization has many false teachings.  <b>The Roman Emporer forced a combining of Biblical and Pagan beliefs, when Rome Nationalized the Church.  Rome forbid the celebration of Biblical Holy days and Sabbaths under threat of beatings, then confiscation of property and finally death.   Many beheaded or burned alive.</b>  Revelation Apocalypse 18:4 says get out of this organization &quot;my people&quot; if you don&#39;t want to receive her plagues.  <b>Freedom to communicate is under attack by Church and State, up to the point they are threatening to bomb the microprocessor production facilities.</b>  Pray for me and you, please!  <b>Russia says they have the proof that Britain was involved in at least thres major terror attacks against Russia.</b>  Would Russia bomb their own 5+ Billion pipeline, their own bridge, powerplants and Navel yards?  <b>NATO said that they would attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize their island, because Australia would feel threatened, but NATO was militarizing Ukraine, where they had bunkers full of weapons.  NATO&#39;s puppet regime in Ukraine was banning the Russian language and culture even though that was many people&#39;s only language.  The Ukrainian Capital is a Russian word until Western media changed it to hide the Russian history, as Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a recent NATO coup, which the US planned, as they told their dignitaries not to attend the Russian Olympics at that time. You could go to prison for teaching the Russian language. All opposition parties in Ukraine (banned).  Those with out blue arm bands(now yellow?) being put to death.</b>  Many US Officials had been talking about a coming war with Russia and China.  Years in advance.  <b>Donald J Trump said he couldn&#39;t answer corona virus questions claiming we are at war.</b>  Trump said that the US will soon be at war with Russia and China. <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, but are part of China, as acknowledged by most nations of the world till recently.</b>  NATO is planning to do to Taiwan and China what they did to Ukraine and Russia.  <b>Britain fighting for Democracy in Ukraine?  Britain has had two or three Prime Ministers that have not been ellected, trying to help the naked Emporer.</b>  Think!  <b>Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband&#39;s attack is a fraud.  The Police changed and contradicted the events multiple times and it makes no sense.</b>  Corona virus is a code name for information that exposes the crown(Government/Royals).  A vaccine is computer/electronic device program that deletes information from your view(anti virus software).  Symptoms for a biological virus comes from being gased, radiated or sprayed in your environment.  <b>Planes fly in parallel patterns, causing heating of your environment and breathing difficulties.  Like Hitler killed by Zyklon B gas, so now they use a deadly gas in incubators.</b>  Donald J Trump said he would put Hilary R Clinton in prison when ellected for starting a war and genocide in Libya, but when he got in power did nothing.  Americans have started many unjust wars.  <b>America/NATO is about to start wars with Ethiopia, Haiti, Taiwan, Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the list goes on.  NATO Countries have invaded more than half of all sovereign Nations on earth, in the last 30 years.</b>  When you print money on paper and then go buy things with it, and it is not backed by any thing then you have to attack a lot of people to keep the scheme going.  <b>New Central Bank digital currencies(CBDCs) will be centralized and backed only by cow farts and trust, where as Bitcoin is decentralized and backed by gold.  Bitcoin/gold and silver came under a major attack by the crown(governments).  The digital currencies will create a M.O.B. type system, that if you get in government cross hairs you will be shut out of the system just like Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Russia and so on and so on.  If they do it to a complete Country, then they will have no problem doing it to individuals.  Canada confiscated people&#39;s money breaking international law.</b>  Rome enters a Country, exterminates, and keeps the remaining people&#39;s in refugee camps called Reserves.  Periodically they thin out the population.  They usually make a lot of noise about sport team names with Native names and how people are trying to erase their names, so as to hide the real erasure of actual peoples.  <b>Revelation 7:9, God says he would take out of all Nations and Tribes and Peoples a people for himself.  God accepts all those who accept him of all Nationalities.</b>  Donald J Trump started operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American people by military nurses.  Trump added death by electrocution, firing squad, poison gas to the already used lethal injection.   <b>Trump foretold war on Russia and China years in advance, a said no one would protect the Pope more than him.</b>  America turned it&#39;s back on God, so now he is turning his back on you.  <b>The US, Canada, Germany, Italy, Britain, Australia, Austria, Ukraine and many other Nations refused to agree and voted against a move at the United Nations to condemn Nazism.  Russia voted against Nazism.  Remember the Nazis?  They started WW2 and exterminated 12000000 human beings, often by extremely cruel means.  The Ukraine military has a entire Nazi battalion the Azov Nazi battalion.  Church leaders clearly seen in Hitler&#39;s Nazi SS footage blessing the troops before slaughters.  The Azov Steel Works was full of Nazis that surrendered to Russia, with pictures confirming their Nazi swastikas tattooed on their bodies.</b>  Ukraine banned all opposition parties and is trying to exterminate the Russian language, people and culture.  Teachers are sent to prison for teaching the Russian language in areas where most only speak Russian.  <b>Fighting for Democracy?</b>  Britain installed two Prime Ministers that were not elected.  <b>Donald J Trump used his office while President to start a business so called &quot;Truth Social&quot; that he claimed would enable free speech.  Later Mr.Trump tried to get the Justice department to stop late night hosts from talking about him.  So supposedly creating free speech over here, but attacking free speech over there.</b>  Russia and China no longer accept US fiat currency, so G7 banned Russian gold. Supposed unbiased media not allowing comments, is a mass deception and contrary to their purpose. CBDCs attacking crypto. 1933 the US confiscated gold.   For 50 years, 10 years in prison for having it, and only ended when gold was separated from backing money in 1971 now backed by cow farts. 2022 Biden bans Russian gold.

9015,kXvwHAeWYqs,Dream 11 is just gambling it&#39;s even worst then a crypto market,
9016,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Bro.. very well explained.. by listening the business model or how it works, i can&#39;t avoid but comparing it with stock market.. <br>Players = company<br>Skills = market cap or price<br>Players past record =  past financial docs<br>Pitch/dew factor= micro economics<br>Coaching/training = macro economics<br>Dream 11 =stock broker, who always gets paid<br>Players = investors/traders<br><br>As always we lose the money, as manipulation is a given fact..",

9018,kXvwHAeWYqs,hmmm i have been playing dream 11 since 2020 i participate in almost all matches <br>i usually make a safe blanced team and one risky team for a match and apy 30 rs for each team <br>one day i opened my profile and  analyzed the safe team lost that 30rs only 3.48% (but the profit was only500 in all matches)of time <br>and the risky team won 60% percentage of the time (the net profit was around 15K  )<br>so if u have proper knowledge of the form of players and the field conditions a common sense in crickets <br>u wont loss money <br>and i personally dont play for money just to increase fun and excitement in a game i was already gonna watch and i make the team while traveling or something so not much lose of time also at the end u decide if its skill or luck i would say its almost like stock market u invest based   company preformance <br><br><br>and also i have lost more matches when it comes to rcb because of picking players sometimes due to emotions <br>like always making vk captain  lol,
9019,kXvwHAeWYqs,Owesome,

9022,kXvwHAeWYqs,Chutiya .... bas gol gol ghuma raha,
9023,kXvwHAeWYqs,"I have noticed many times in the last 10 overs, Dream11 manipulates points, even if your players selected is playing from both ends, that is striker and non striker and scoring runs and the bowler bowling is not picked in your team, at this time your points should be in the green and not still be in the red. I have noticed several times they are definitely manipulating to make sure that they have more number of participants money is lost, so that Dream 11 can make more money. Normally the participants do not look at these things and thinks ok fine I lost. Check this out till the last ball is bowled you would see many times when you are about to just win, they will suddenly show the participants in loosing  zone. This is my experience only, I don&#39;t know if others have noticed this. Definitely Bots are used in several matches to win the games",

There are many advantages of playing fantasy sports....<br>1) It increases your ability of decision making<br>2) Observing small things <br>3) Analytical skills<br>4) Statistical skills <br> As we all everything has two sides... If you are playing for  long time it does not require that much of time... You already know how a player plays , how he has been performing..  and whoever big companies are available in the market everyone is making money from something, even Google makes money from our data.... No offence btw ,I&#39;m just presenting my POV.",

They also have (ssshhhh) BOT!, which will be introduced at the middle of the game with real name in it.  You don&#39;t have absolutely no control at the end of the match, who are all these people toping in the end and you have been thrown out!    Its all algorithm.  easy to manipulate.  Dream11 knows nobody has time to collect  3 Lakh people team writing down  at the beginning of the match to analyze.",

9041,kXvwHAeWYqs,"I played few matches with dream 11. Soon realised that there can be an algorithm that runs depending on match situation and creates new participants eventually winning the prize. These are my thoughts, I may be wrong. Lost around 1k and decided never to play again.",

9051,kXvwHAeWYqs,"I have won 30 lakhs, 5 lakhs and 1 lakhs in Grand league. Yes D11 can be addictive but it has changed future of many poor and middle class people. Spending just 10-15 mins a day is fine in creating a D11 team instead of wasting 6-7 hours on Insta, FB, YT. You never know you might get lucky one day and earn millions of rupees which is very very important in today&#39;s life.",

9062,kXvwHAeWYqs,Sad to see top sports people promoting such a platform...,
9063,kXvwHAeWYqs,dream 11 is 10% skill 20% probability(creating multiple combination) and 70 % luck to be at top 1% in my opinion,
9064,kXvwHAeWYqs,"üî¥üî¥üî¥One more information to add which is very important üî¥üî¥üî¥<br><br>Dream 11 has other way of earning money- In a contest of big leagues like 2 crore, 3 crore or any other high winning leagues, there are many participants who participate. For example like in the above video there was a contest which had 3 lakh participants. Among the 3 lakh participants, hardly 50 thousand people participate. The remaining 2.5 lakh participants are added as bots with different names by Dream 11 company with all possible permutations and combinations of players. This makes the bots(Dream 11) win everytime because of the different combinations of players. This is the reason even though there are so many big money winning contests going on everyday, there are only few persons who reported winnings publicly. This is other source of income for dream 11 because they win money in the big contests and the 50 thousand participants either win very less amount or mostly no money at all.",
9065,kXvwHAeWYqs,awesome,
9066,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Here&#39;s the detail we missed out on<br><br>Dream 11 gives you free credit worth ‚Çπ200 with a new account, and the biggest pools have a low entry bar, &lt; ‚Çπ100 <br>So what happens is that almost all the money in the pool is basically dream11&#39;s own free credit. And any money any player wins is going out of their pocket.<br><br>What they started doing is that they&#39;d make 100s of random bot entries with each possible combination of players and in the bag the entire winnings home.<br><br>Players would usually win a few rupees at best and most will never even make enough to hit the minimum withdrawal threshold, so they&#39;d pump in more of their cash, fail again and then one fine day, get rid of the app",
9067,kXvwHAeWYqs,"If you have to any real chance of winning just not by pure luck, you need to have enormous data to guess anything at all, and there is certain fixed uncertainty for each batch like playing 11 , you will probably need a computer program to guess mostly all the possible combinations . It&#39;s a skill based game but NONE of the common people have it .",
9068,kXvwHAeWYqs,"Cricket is a game, managed by the rich politicians of India, In simple terms BCCI is a mafia, its not a government agency.  Every player is sitting on a money bench, and digital viewers are the Fulfillment model for business. <br><br>IPL... what a platform, a normal cricketer gets to earn crores in just 2 months ... why not when it&#39;s managed like and by a mafia. <br><br>I feel we should have nationalist approach towards building skills when it comes to players,  if that rs 50 is contributed to a digital platform that funds Indian Olympic association would lead to create a better value and future for our country. <br><br><br><br>Mafia is created to control the young brains of our country.",

9077,kXvwHAeWYqs,If the dream11 is doing exactly the way you are telling that is okay. but they are doing some different tactics here. 1)Out of 3 lacs team they will make a 2lacs team by bot system  2)they will release a pdf file of the team after 10min. If the opening batsman out within 10min they will remove that player from their team.,

Steel centers like Mariupol and Krivij Rog  is a major metallurgy center of Europe, not just Ukraine.<br>And when you see how Russian armies kill innocent it is obvious they are after those things, not some made up gibberish about fighting Nazis/ fascism.

US also has the exactly same rule, gambling by chance is banned but gambling by luck is not. <br>Evidently these companies showed example of 2-3 people who  usually wins, to assert that it takes skills to win. Interestingly, the people who were winning were machine learning engineers. Who would take as many data points as possible and then take the decision. They even factored in the humidity, social media buzz of a player.<br>I&#39;m pretty sure these people can hack the dream 11 too.",

Company will X will give only product a if kirana stores buys product b also. <br>Thus Kirana stores are at dis advantages as their inventory goes up with slow moving items. <br>On the other side Kirana stores also at fault for taking their local customers for granted.,

Indeed the dmart offers significant discount by boosting it sales, hence they get more discounts from vendors in regular basis. I would like to add few more points where dmart earns revenue in following areas.<br><br>1) They have private lables which are competitors for high sale product, The dmart either manufacture or market those products and they will be placed those products next to competitive product. ( Ex Mazza- Mango merry, Nescafe - Lecafe, Harpic - Force 10,etc; the products packing are so similar, sometimes even the regular customers can&#39;t differentiate) Since they market/ manufacture this products they are quite cheap compared to the competitive products.<br><br>2) Loose Grocery contributes 23% of daily stores Revenue. Since they obtain the large quantity of Groceries from farmers.( Eliminating the middle men) <br><br>3) Cross Merchandising<br>4) Plastic and glass items are importing from china and rebranding.<br><br><br>Thanks for the wonderful case study Think School, They are so informative..",

9422,odiaekxLY0g,"Bajaj Finserv has been in the market as it comes from legendary Bajaj family,  earning the trust of people.  Then the interest where most of NBFCs charge high,  taking cut from manufacturers worked both ways.<br>That was good thinking. Third as data mining showed the risk profile of customers,  it&#39;s easy to take decision.<br>People wanted hassle free credit and bajaj provided it. <br>As alternative to bank loans,  it is finding the gap in credit market. <br>Where do they get funds as it is known tapping the debt market nationally and financing even in rural areas.  It is to be seen how their rural consumer market penetration is. Also their profit from the revenue is smaller compared to Muthoot finance. Internal efficiency is key to sustain market. <br>Now new forms of credit is rising and let&#39;s see how they manage the competition.",

9428,odiaekxLY0g,Is CRED coins useful like credit card points???,
9429,odiaekxLY0g,"Is it wrong to put it like this, that by going ahead in this direction although it is creating a healthy environment at one place but similarly leaving behind/creating/magnifying a large vaccum in another place. I also guess over a period of time the vaccum would get so large that it would have to self consume/self destruct itself to balance out the happy/healthy end.

9504,LYs4b3fTX7Y,See from my side the worst thing this startups are doing is they are giving discounts in the start of their business as they are spending a ton of money to attract new customers by giving them discount and thinking they will leverage from this after sometime but thats not how it should work see what ola was doing they were spending 200 for a ride from which they will earn 150 rs so directly they are making a loss of 50 rupees by giving discounts to rider and incentives to driver as well to attract them to use their app but i think what they should do in begining is  they should just target the people who were using cabs in daily life see if 3 crore people of india were actually using cabs to travel they should have make a target of 50lac people whom they have provided the service hassle free instead instead of giving discount s to them if I am spending 100 rupees daily as a consumer but i having hard tym to travel to office daily i will prefer 110 if a good cab service will pick me up and drop right i will not go for discount istead i will prefer a good service cab right so ola should have targeted those people only instead of hiving discount to everyone and luir them to use ola uber .They should have target the affordable consumer first and earned from them after that they could have grown in a profitable business now the graph is opposite same thing will happen with zomato dunzo all this giants as in this grocery wala business to they do have lower margin than cab servieces they could not get profitaable this way they will just lose investor moneyüòÖ,

And we users are using it as a part of our life every day. Why can&#39;t Uber or Ola automate everything . To the extent I have knowledge they need employees (other than drivers) to <br>1) verify the driver details (can be outsourced)<br>2) Customer support (can be outsourced)<br>3) accounting can be automated to some extent<br>4) Application (software) maintenance i think so even this can be automated completely .<br> If there are any more pls let me know I can gain knowledge...,

People are covering distance in half a rate through metro as compare to Ola Uber.

9545,LYs4b3fTX7Y,One of the most unethical company,
9546,LYs4b3fTX7Y,"My memories of being an early adopter of Uber way back in November 2013 refreshed. I left my corporate job in 2017 and working from home since then. I don&#39;t take many rides now but speak regularly to drivers. <br><br>What I did notice off-late is- these apps induce lots of anxiety among drivers. Young men have got BP and sugar-like ailments. This they feel when they move out of the gig economy and work for a regular job.  <br><br>As a society, we need to be conscious of protecting regular paying jobs. Though I like gigs more profitable, that is not the case with those who are easygoing in their life. Just because somebody is easygoing, we must not punish them too harshly. <br><br>This is my general sense. As much as possible, we must educate drivers and delivery boys for making more savings rather than upgrading their lifestyles.  <br><br>Hope this community passes that wisdom to delivery boys now as and when they get an opportunity. <br><br>Thanks.",
9547,LYs4b3fTX7Y,How ola is in loss dude; it costs so much high fares üòÇüòÇ,
9548,LYs4b3fTX7Y,"As the number of cab drivers falls, the salaries of the those who continue to stay would stabilize and increase. Ola will stabilize soon in my opinon. However, diversifying into electric vehicles was a bad move.",
9549,LYs4b3fTX7Y,OLA driver  asks customer  to cancel service  after his entry into cab  Comes for same charges for that ride. But later when customer takes ola ride   past cancellation charge is collected I was victim also Avoid ola as much as possible  Why ola drivers are doing this  must be known to its administration  Also ola charges are little costly at some times  Public opinion is not so good  and so it&#39;s business will go down,
9550,LYs4b3fTX7Y,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ola"">#ola</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23olacabs"">#olacabs</a> The Problem is not just for Ola its for many similar Startups, Indians are so used to free things and these startups use the same strategy as politicians gathering votes, but in the long run they are no able to even get back what they gave free! the Ola apps sucks ! drivers demand additional charges and if the customers don&#39;t agree they refuse to take the rides and Ola has no way to help the customer get a ride. there is no way to complain about this. they need to see apps such as didi (in china) the apps are so marvellous and if the driver refuses to pick up the customer or asks for additional cost the customer can immediately complain. the navigation system is very mediocre. The main reason why riders shifted to apps like OLA is for convenience and right pricing. Now it is no more convenient and no more cheap. off people in Ola were so amazing they would have fixed this small issue much earlier. <br><br>Apart from all this the most important issues is the kind of commission these startup are starting to charge. when there is exorbitant profit there will either be exorbitant competition or exorbitant problem. This is the case for all start-ups in India soon Swiggy, zomato, mobile payment services will also have same problems, unless otherwise they change their attitude to giving free and trying to collect it back later.",

9553,LYs4b3fTX7Y,Every party in a business must get profit above their cost price.Otherwise they are just going to create some confusion for some years by destroying business that are genuinely done and then fall themselves.,
9554,LYs4b3fTX7Y,The reason why I stopped using ola is coz after taking a ride i paid the driver whole amount using upi but they kept sending me due amount notifications and didn&#39;t allow me to book cab until i cleared that due amount. I mailed the customer care showing the proof of payment but never got my issue resolved.  And their customer care  number is useless. So I&#39;m left with uber only option.,

9649,9SmS3qLe00k,Very inspiring and motivating story. Very useful information.,
9650,9SmS3qLe00k,"No matter what or who,we can&#39;t and never can compare ourselves to Japan..it&#39;s a total different country",
9651,9SmS3qLe00k,"TLDR, India cannot learn much from Japan. They are very different countries with different histories, circumstance, and different cultures.<br><br>1.) Japan is Confucian in culture, India is not. Confucius cultures (South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, China) are world famous for creating extremely efficient bureaucracies. This is a strength that India cannot replicate, even the West cannot copy this. This is an inherent strength to their way of thinking and their political philosophy. I have literally NEVER seen a Non-East Asian person practice or even engage in the study of Confucianism. The ideas are too foreign and it&#39;s precepts are too strict for outsiders to accept, understand, and least of all appreciate. Like the rest of the world, Indians will NEVER accept Confucianism and thus never benefit from it&#39;s advantage of efficient bureaucracy.<br><br>2.) Japan is a homogenous culture, 99.99% of the Japanese people are not only of one race, but of one ethnicity. India has many different races, ethnicities, and religions. The Japanese speak one single language, when the prime minster of Japan speaks, everyone listens and can understand him; India speaks over 200 languages and dialects, many of which are mutually unintelligible. This fact alone makes communication, cooperation, and logistics in India EXTREMELY difficult. Something Japan never had to deal with.<br><br>3.) Japan was never colonized by the West, India was brutally colonized and exploited by the West for centuries. Thus the historical mentality of the nations are very different. Because of their history, Indians have a victim mentality and a superiority complex. The Japanese do not suffer from these things. The Japanese are confident in their culture and see no benefit in nationalistic pride, political bickering, and/or blaming others for their problems. Have you ever met a Japanese person demanding reparations from the USA for being nuked in WWII? NEVER. The Japanese people are a proud people, their expression of pride is pride in their work and their contributions to their society. It&#39;s not the Western form of pride that is based on a superiority complex which just leads to endless debates and arguments that yield nothing; Of which Indians have unfortunately, adopted.<br><br><br><br>4.) Last but not least, even though Japan was physically destroyed by the end of WWII, it&#39;s people were not. The expertise, engineers, businessmen, and human capital was not. They rebuilt extremely quickly because they still had that thing that is most critical to building an economy: talented Human capital. The same thing happened in Germany. India is FAR behind in human development and will have to invest heavily in developing their human capital for many generations before they can reach what is required to modernize. Rebuilding a country is very easy if you have the human capital to do it. China knows this all too well and invests HEAVILY in developing, maintaining, and keeping their human capital. India falls short on investing in this critical part of their development all the time. The Worst part is India&#39;s system actually encourages their most talented people to move overseas to the West. India needs to stop this and incentivize it&#39;s most talented people to remain in India.<br><br>There is an old saying that goes: &quot;Indians are massively successful everywhere, except in India&quot;. This needs to stop. When young talented Indians can confidently say, &quot;my best chance for success and a better life is in India&quot;, this is when India will become a world power.",
9652,9SmS3qLe00k,"So in conclusion, it is the people and their mindset about a common goal that helped Japan become what it is today. Something like this might never happen in India since majority of the people are not up to this mindset because of our large population. More importantly, the education system in Japan also teaches moral standards which leads to the people becoming better at life while in India morals have very less value in the education system. I am not saying Indians are not good but since India has a huge population majority people can&#39;t become better in our current system and lifestyle. We&#39;re just making more and more people, sending 50% of the smart ones abroad to pay taxes to other countries and keeping 100% of the illiterate one&#39;s at home that don&#39;t even know the worth of life and for sure can&#39;t pay taxes (or don&#39;t want to). Still, hope is everything I believe. Jai Hind.",

It‚Äôs 33% of his video but these are minute contributions in the grand scheme of things. They are easy to be copied by other countries. They are not so great like he says. They can not compete with the cheap labor sourcing of other countries. That cheap sourcing will transfer from China to other countries like India and Africa and countries like China and Korea will start to eat away at Japan‚Äôs more complex manufacturing industry.

He does not mention all the money received from America and all the changes made by the Americans which caused Japan to flourish. <br><br>japan is NOT a good model. They have no system built to encourage new ideas and new businesses.

It is also why, despite having their domestic Blockbuster type video rental (Tsutaya), they failed to adapt and Netflix rules streaming video here (in Japan and in the world).<br><br>They are xenophobic. Wages haven‚Äôt risen here in 30 years and they won‚Äôt let immigrants come in en masse to support the social economic system. They won‚Äôt allow foreigners to travel here for such a long time. They have an aging population and the social security system is collapsing. Kyoto is going bankrupt and this is also because they have all their business congested in Tokyo. This coupled with their need to meet face to face to conduct business leads to huge inefficiencies which is why they‚Äôre famous for ‚Äúhard working‚Äù. No, they do not work hard, they work LONG. Work smart, is not what they do. This is part of the reason why their suicide rate is so high. People crawling out of their little box homes in Tokyo to go and work 12+ hours a day, most of which is made up of unnecessary meetings, is no way to live a life.",
9654,9SmS3qLe00k,"GARBAGE AND BULLOCKS: I was teaching and researching this subject at a major university at the time of Japan&#39;s rise and fall. This article overlooks the DOWNFALL OF JAPAN in the 1990s, and Japan&#39;s totally different position in the world today. Japan&#39;s economy developed TOTALLY under American supervision and with HUGE American investment after the War, as America viewed an economically successful Japan as a bulwark against Communism. Japan developed under American supervision, and with AMERICAN COOPERATION, and it NEVER took a foreign policy stance against America.<br><br>Now, sadly, Japan&#39;s economy is in a tailspin, and it has been largely eclipsed by China. I don&#39;t think India is prepared to lose a war to America, which worked great for Japan and Germany, nor do I think it is ready to be a stalwart supporter of American policy, as Japan was and is. Perhaps the best lesson India might learn is how to avoid building massive government debt and an overheated economy, which are generally beleived to have been responsible for Japan&#39;s downfall.",

9687,9SmS3qLe00k,"Good video here. But I just like to point out the fact that, try as we might, India wouldn&#39;t have been able to grow the same way as Japan. Japan&#39;s infrastructure was destroyed but its systems were largely intact. Also, since the Americans took over defence, they didn&#39;t need much of a standing army. In fact, the self-defense force was created mainly out of need since they faced some problems during the Korean War. The efficiency of their systems aside, their alliance with the Americans gave them access to markets they would&#39;ve found hard to tap into on their own. Thus, while the Japanese achieved a good deal, their post-war growth was mainly due to their connections. Despite their cruelty, I would respect imperial Japan to an extent. But their situation is not the same as our situation. This is one thing the policymakers never understood. Far from creating jobs, Indira Gandhi and Nehru increased unemployment by their socialistic tendencies. The mentality of the people back then is another issue. During the British Raj, you could either get a job in some English factory or you could be employed in a government office under either the British administration or the Princes. There were a few industrial houses even back then like the Tatas and Birlas but instead of focusing on helping them grow, create jobs and on creating more such companies, the politicians made people fight over reservations in government jobs. It became a question of different sets of cronies living off the taxpayers as governments changed mainly because we had leaders who only knew how to take and extract, not to enable or create. In addition, we had 2 hostile neighbors and not a few internal issues. Even if we wanted to, we couldn&#39;t have reduced defence spending. In fact, the banks that were nationalized by Indira Gandhi were following a system similar to the Keiretsus and giving loans to the large industrial houses. She nationalized them and pushed them to focus more on agriculture. I can&#39;t say food security had no benefits and this was a move that was welcomed when it was originally rolled out. But of course, it did create long-term problems with enormous defaults and poor industrial growth.  This was the kind of environment that we had to work with. More than 80% of our population was illiterate and could not afford education. There were more factors involved as far as India was and is concerned than just a question of our people&#39;s laziness. In terms of structure and economy, we were a bamboo stick and Japan was a well-forged if broken sword.  Even now, we have only just realized our real potential. We have only just begun developing it. Giving credit where it&#39;s due, developing even to the extent we have is significant given that for every step forward, there was always someone or something wanting to push us 10 steps back.",

Arab members of the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) protested the West‚Äôs support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War by stopping oil shipments to the United States, Japan and Western Europe. OPEC also flexed its new-found economic muscle by quadrupling oil prices, placing a choke-hold on America‚Äôs oil-hungry consumers and industries. The embargo had a global impact, sending the U.S. and European economies into recession. As part of his response to the embargo, President Nixon signed a federal law lowering all national highway speed limits to 55 mph The act was intended to force Americans to drive at speeds deemed more fuel-efficient, thereby curbing the U.S. appetite for foreign oil. This way Japanese fuel efficient cars became popular in USA",

9719,3tVoKZ5pHMU,Not applicable to IIT&#39;s,
9720,3tVoKZ5pHMU,"Because of an inordinate and rigid emphasis on grades, our education system is training students to write and excel at exams. Education always looks to the past in order to preserve the past. It concerns itself with &quot;what was and what is&quot; as against &quot;what could be&quot;. Curiosity,  exploration and creativity ( hallmark of childhood) are systematically killed in schools. Analytical thinking , while necessary, isn&#39;t adequate to address problems in a world that&#39;s changing at unprecedented speed. Our pupils have become competent at breaking down a problem,  identifying chains of cause and effect and describing it. An overwhelming majority of them use word &quot;because&quot; excessively. That&#39;s all there is. No encouragement for asking &quot;why not&quot; as it smacks of rebellion and challenge to status quo. Pity that &quot;why not&quot; has the seeds of creative new ideas. &quot;Because&quot; is descriptive - it cannot lead to new ideas. &quot;Why not&quot; is generative - it leads to new creation. High time we introduced Design from standard 8, as it can train pupils to leave aside the obvious and work toward non-standard, unconventional solutions.",

9748,3tVoKZ5pHMU,One of the best lecture we missed in our engineering times !,
9749,3tVoKZ5pHMU,"There is one more important point<br>Which everyone ignores <br>Literally everyone<br>In school colleges importance is given to theory part not practical ,,<br>Reading this feels soo silly isn&#39;t it , oki let me give you an example,<br>Few years back we had computer subject in <a href=""http://b.com/"">b.com</a> and our lecturer taught us html which was basics of coding and no one knew that we were learning coding literally,, our fault was we didn&#39;t learn properly we didn&#39;t attend cls regularly but the mistake of our lecturer was there was not a single practical class with a computer , we wudve know wat we were learning, and the fun fact is our cls topper didn&#39;t even know that it was just a basics of coding, <br>Practical is more important than theory. <br>Practical is the best way to learn anything in a fastest way ,<br>If we can&#39;t apply a particular thing in our life to see how it works then only we should focus on theory....",

I just know that I got a degree that just BE passed.<br>3. In 3rd year 5th sem college placement training, again they are going with very small introduction of DB, C, Java, aptitude to get placement I have sit there to get placement in company. But you know what happens I didn&#39;t sit any placements not any single company. Why because I don&#39;t know what is engineering? That question I asked many times to myself. I have searched for books where I realised  that I am not qualified for engineering.<br>4. You know when I got to know about engineering subjects when I prepared for GATE, then I got real understanding how engineer thinks. <br>5. You are telling right every engineering college is became a business. There aim is to get as many as admission and to make lots of money but not making student to realise his full potential.

We should not at least let that happen.",
9905,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Hi,¬†<br><br><br>I am going to highlight a thing at which nobody so far has noticed. It‚Äôs about ethical turned unethical practices of a Indian reputed firm so called ‚ÄúZomato‚Äù. The era of food delivery at home started around a decade ago which soon started becoming popular among one an all eventually and now almost is a name on each and everybody‚Äôs mouth. Myself, also being a very big foodie started availing Zomato‚Äôs delivery service sitting home which was an awesome experience in starting years. Food delivery those days was costing not much expensive. Zomato‚Äôs surcharges from their partner restaurant which usually includes commission, tax on commission, and other minor charges which cumulatively summed up t0 17-19 % in till the years of 2019-20. Then pandemic changed everything and spared not business / person however It‚Äôs Zomato who fed every needy individual while sitting at home. This model was very much appreciated during those days and it was hugely considered by everyone that Zomato is the future of the outside food but nobody then knew the dark truth to be come in time to come.¬†<br><br>Before all this story I would like to introduce myself briefly. I‚Äôm 36 years old individual qualified as a Chemical Engineer with working experience of 10+ years. My last jobs were with reputed companies i.e. JSW group, Toranagallu, Karnataka (Epsilon Carbon) and Tata Chemicals, Mithapur Salt plant (through third party) and my last drawn salary was 9.36 Lakh per annum. After a long span of living a family life in these remote areas and meanwhile pandemic effects on job market made me awake to enter into cloud kitchen business which used to be my passion. I took a huge risk leaving my job aside and started a cloud kitchen after trying for around 8-9 months. I had no lack of passion and was not at all scared of hard work. I was very much confident about my abilities and experience which I assumed will help me grow in the business. Zomato for me then was just you, I or anyone else know about.<br><br>My online food selling business started in May 2022 after documental formalities. Till that date, Zomato‚Äôs commission (including everything) officially was rose to 27% which is a lion‚Äôs share in profit. When we talk about eateries (restaurants, food stalls, street food stalls, Thelewala), 70% of the business even don‚Äôt manage to earn (say take home wages) this much amount to their home (27%).¬†<br><br>Now the story comes to Zomato.¬†<br><br>Earlier we used to go outside physically at restaurant to have our food whenever we wanted to do. Zomato eventually changed the picture and made things easy. Although, people merely experienced when their meal plate became costlier like anything in very short time span. Due to this Zomato‚Äôs huge commission restaurants started hiking their price by 30-35% which was substantial amount in this short period. A person who was getting average meal for say i.e. at INR 150 + taxes + delivery charge) which may be approximate INR 175,¬† he started getting the same food Rs. 250 or even more.¬†<br><br>If restaurant tries to maintain the hiked price to make sale balanced, he falls in great loss.¬†<br><br>27% commission and taxes too just a myth. Restaurant encourages or simply speaking blackmails restaurants to do participate in promotional programmes which are chargeable schemes. It means if restaurants don‚Äôt participate in programmes, their visibility on Zomato app will be as poor as that restaurant will hardly get a couple of orders in a day. Now the actual expenditure on Zomato ad comes into picture. They have customized many plans and schemes to be opted by restaurant partners. Big daddys in restaurant business can afford and select high package schemes whereas even a ordinary package is costlier for a common food service provider though no option left but to go with ad scheme. It indirectly adds an additional average 5%¬† load of 27% discount summing it to 33%.¬†<br><br>The story doesn‚Äôt even end here. Unethical practices from Zomato leave the businessmen in no way unturned to earn his bread and butter. Every now and then, Zomato sends a mail to their restaurant partners that they are starting a campaign where restaurant‚Äôs visibility will be made higher on Zomato food delivery app for which they have to opt for their scheme in which restaurant has to provide a discount to customer. This discounted amount is completely borne by restaurant however Zomato never highlights the same and takes all the credit of discount by Zomato itself from customers. A dirty reality is that customer always thinks that the discount being offered is by Zomato but not by restaurant. I some case if under-priced food, any complaint is raised by customer which comes in the form of review / ratings which directly affect restaurant‚Äôs overall image and rating. However up to this it‚Äôs fine but in some cases spam ratings also take place for which Zomato never let restaurant speak directly to customer due to which their probability of making the repeated mistake can be nullified.<br><br>As mentioned above, these promotional campaign sometimes are imposed without authorization of restaurant. Restaurant comes to know on this when a lot of orders are already gone. These discount promos are operated by Zomato itself hence can‚Äôt be stopped by self. It takes 2-3 days after your complaint to get the promo offer stopped. Till the same time, you have no other option left with you to do. First is to turning the restaurant off on Zomato (which negatively impacts the image of restaurant on customers) and other is to bear the losses of unauthorized discounts (unwillingly but only to show the restaurant open). Due to policies made by Zomato, if we reject the order in this case, visibility of restaurant becomes so poor that restaurant may not receive new customer orders for couple of days. This thing has been experienced by me 4-5 times in last few months, and subsequently Zomato has not compensated for losses anytime or eben not bothered to revert on raised tickets.<br><br>Next point is that Zomato is so unethical that many restaurant which are getting continuous negative rating however managed to maintain the restaurant rating as 4+ on app. It doesn‚Äôt apply for common restaurants who are not capable to pay heft ransom in form of paid ads. Zomato doesn‚Äôt share its algorithm methodology (confidential as per Zomato) which they use for restaurant‚Äôs overall rating calculation and on the basis of same they are not all bothered to answer your restaurant‚Äôs rating improvement. Overall rating on Zomato is a main factor depending upon which the sales is dependant. I tried no stone unturned to improve my retuarant‚Äôs rating by getting maximum 5 stars however failed to improve because Zomato is not all bothered to answer.<br><br>Each and every query is raised in form of tickets to Zomato. Its replied with customized and computerized mails and tickets are closed furher. There is no direct telephonic link to talk to Zomato anytime in <a href=""http://need.in/"">need.In</a> this case we feel nothing but helpless.¬†<br><br>8 out of 10 restaurants are being closing every year but now I came to know that 4 of them are deserving but are victims of business based corruption say monopolization / duopolization.<br><br>Surprisingly, there is no proper authority is controlling these firm. This is directly affecting consumers. The days are not far when food will not be in plates. It will be in small bowls.¬†<br><br>The above content is a brief article that I would like to convey to you in hope that it will be highlighted and brought to consumers. The time is not far when Zomato will be a modern franchise version of EAST INDIA COMPANY. I‚Äôm already at the verge of closing my kitchen but before that I want to let the reality come in everybody‚Äôs knowledge.<br><br>Many more things are there which I‚Äôm not highlighting in this short mail.<br><br>Support data on my mails can be produced if any action is likely to be taken from your end.<br><br>Lastly, I would only like to say,<br><br><br>SAVE YOUR PLATE.",
9906,fTuVWwTQegQ,By laying off their employees,
9907,fTuVWwTQegQ,Food delivery is not a profitable business unless someone invents teleporting in the next few years. The razor thin margins is not enough to attract investors interest and the same also means small changes in costs can severely flip a profit making company to a loss making one,

9962,fTuVWwTQegQ,note it down. Zomato is never going to be profitable. Any investor buying stocks watching this shit is down 60% or even more. This video came right before IPO. You r just making fool out of people. Its just the game of valuation. Stock market shows u the reality.,
9963,fTuVWwTQegQ,I so want to believe in the Zomato growth story. For the past few weeks I am up-skilling so that I can contribute to Zomato&#39;s journey. But the very fact that the promoters hold 0% shares makes me feel it as a landmine. Do you have any take on this?,

9976,fTuVWwTQegQ,It is not easy to copy the food compared electronic items..in food people need variety nobody orders from same place every day..everyone needs different food and different brand .even if Zomato copies the food and taste it will be branded as Zomato food not McDonald&#39;s or KFC or any other restaurants,

You can already see there is huge cost difference between the home order and when you visit restaurant... I have already reduced my orders online for two reasons... One it&#39;s expensive to eat at home and you don&#39;t have feeling of restaurant food... Amazon is still not able to make decent ac or tv (see their rating in Amazon itself) forget about indian food quality... We can&#39;t make food homogeneous..,

10167,wAHSJgIx5wA,"So the thing is to make a great product or service first. Now the crucial point is making a product/service that serves the customers and fulfils their needs. When a product can satisfy a consumer then the producers can relate it to the consumer&#39;s life hence speaking a story that speaks to the customer. This creates a bond and an identity is created. Proving my favourite line, people are the core of the business.",

10281,Rh30CfP7ncA,"Hydrogen as an Alternative Fuel<br>Hydrogen is considered an alternative fuel under the¬†Energy Policy Act of 1992. The interest in hydrogen as an alternative transportation fuel stems from its ability to power fuel cells in zero-emission vehicles, its potential for domestic production, and the¬†fuel cell&#39;s¬†fast filling time and high efficiency. In fact, a fuel cell coupled with an electric motor is two to three times more efficient than an internal combustion engine running on gasoline. Hydrogen can also serve as fuel for internal combustion engines. However, unlike FCEVs, these produce tailpipe emissions and are less efficient. Learn more about¬†fuel cells.<br><br>The energy in 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) of hydrogen gas is about the same as the energy in 1 gallon (6.2 pounds, 2.8 kilograms) of gasoline. Because hydrogen has a low volumetric energy density, it is stored onboard a vehicle as a compressed gas to achieve the driving range of conventional vehicles...wikipedia.

What a sad state of affairs,
10287,Rh30CfP7ncA,"<b>History repeating like during WW2 and WW1/Spanish plague.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now under WW3 and a corona virus pandemic. Hitler used Zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the fumant removed.  It causes symptoms like corona virus.  Look up in the sky you will see planes spraying your cities!  Hitler attacked Russia, just like what is happening now.  The British Empire had no legal male Heir so they imported a fake one from Germany.  The British Queen&#39;s husband &quot;Prince Philip&quot; renounced his German citizenship, became a Greek citizen and as a Greek citizen moved to Britain gaining citizenship there.  After gaining citizenship, he was appointed a Duke, out of thin air and then as a Prince and married Queen Elizabeth.  &quot;Prince Philip&quot; took the name of the Queen, not the other way, as it usually is done, where a wife takes the husband&#39;s name.  The British Empire has run out of male Heirs at least twice, and they kill to suppress it.    WW2 was a way of hiding this fraud, and now WW3 is a way of hiding that illegal combines Heir. The Bible says that a male would not fail to sit on the throne.  A family name continues through the males, not the females, and Philip was a fraud.  He had become a Greek citizen to make it appear that he was a Royal from the earlier Greek dynasty.</b>  Total theater.  <b>The Catholic Empires of the Roman Empire form one leg and the UK(British controlled) Empire forms the other leg of the Roman Empire, with the King Pope Francis as the ruler of the whole system.  He has a triple teired crown with 666 on it in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  He is a King of the city state of the Vatican(the Vatican is the smallest Country in the world), Rome Italy, and is mentioned in Revelation, Apocalypse, 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions that this Empire is responsible for all those slaughtered on earth.  It mention what the leaders wear, which is scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  The UK leg Royals also wear those colors, a long with Judges and Magistrates of the Crown.  They refer to this entity as the Crown.  When some one goes to court in one of the British subservient Nations, it is said that the Crown has a case against the person.</b>  Canada, Australian and others are not sovereign or free.  please read Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, and study it closely, because this Empire comes as a false system claiming to represent God, but exterminates to stay in power.  <b>1Timothy3:1-16 mentions that the one looking after a group(Church) should be a husband of one wife with obedient children.  The Pope and the Priests of the Catholic Church are forbidden to marry, and so don&#39;t even qualify, according to the very book and God they say they claim to represent(an unmarried man has no wife or children.)   The Bible&#39;s Peter&#39;s mother in-law was cured by Jesus(Yeshua).  So if Peter had a mother in law, then he had a wife as there is no other way.</b>  That is why Catholic Priest have sex with so many little boys, girls and women attendees.  <b>There was over ninety cases of Preists molesting little boys in the city of Boston, USA alone.  None of the Priests were disciplined, but were only moved to a different location, and now you know why.  The whole system is a fraud.</b>  So this organization has many false teachings.  <b>The Roman Emporer forced a combining of Biblical and Pagan beliefs, when Rome Nationalized the Church.  Rome forbid the celebration of Biblical Holy days and Sabbaths under threat of beatings, then confiscation of property and finally death.   Many beheaded or burned alive.</b>  Revelation Apocalypse 18:4 says get out of this organization &quot;my people&quot; if you don&#39;t want to receive her plagues.  <b>Freedom to communicate is under attack by Church and State, up to the point they are threatening to bomb the microprocessor production facilities.</b>  Pray for me and you, please!  <b>Russia says they have the proof that Britain was involved in at least thres major terror attacks against Russia.</b>  Would Russia bomb their own 5+ Billion pipeline, their own bridge, powerplants and Navel yards?  <b>NATO said that they would attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize their island, because Australia would feel threatened, but NATO was militarizing Ukraine, where they had bunkers full of weapons.  NATO&#39;s puppet regime in Ukraine was banning the Russian language and culture even though that was many people&#39;s only language.  The Ukrainian Capital is a Russian word until Western media changed it to hide the Russian history, as Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a recent NATO coup, which the US planned, as they told their dignitaries not to attend the Russian Olympics at that time. You could go to prison for teaching the Russian language. All opposition parties in Ukraine (banned).  Those with out blue arm bands(now yellow?) being put to death.</b>  Many US Officials had been talking about a coming war with Russia and China.  Years in advance.  <b>Donald J Trump said he couldn&#39;t answer corona virus questions claiming we are at war.</b>  Trump said that the US will soon be at war with Russia and China. <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, but are part of China, as acknowledged by most nations of the world till recently.</b>  NATO is planning to do to Taiwan and China what they did to Ukraine and Russia.  <b>Britain fighting for Democracy in Ukraine?  Britain has had two or three Prime Ministers that have not been ellected, trying to help the naked Emporer.</b>  Think!  <b>Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband&#39;s attack is a fraud.  The Police changed and contradicted the events multiple times and it makes no sense.</b>  Corona virus is a code name for information that exposes the crown(Government/Royals).  A vaccine is computer/electronic device program that deletes information from your view(anti virus software).  Symptoms for a biological virus comes from being gased, radiated or sprayed in your environment.  <b>Planes fly in parallel patterns, causing heating of your environment and breathing difficulties.  Like Hitler killed by Zyklon B gas, so now they use a deadly gas in incubators.</b>  Donald J Trump said he would put Hilary R Clinton in prison when ellected for starting a war and genocide in Libya, but when he got in power did nothing.  Americans have started many unjust wars.  <b>America/NATO is about to start wars with Ethiopia, Haiti, Taiwan, Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the list goes on.  NATO Countries have invaded more than half of all sovereign Nations on earth, in the last 30 years.</b>  When you print money on paper and then go buy things with it, and it is not backed by any thing then you have to attack a lot of people to keep the scheme going.  <b>New Central Bank digital currencies(CBDCs) will be centralized and backed only by cow farts and trust, where as Bitcoin is decentralized and backed by gold.  Bitcoin/gold and silver came under a major attack by the crown(governments).  The digital currencies will create a M.O.B. type system, that if you get in government cross hairs you will be shut out of the system just like Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Russia and so on and so on.  If they do it to a complete Country, then they will have no problem doing it to individuals.  Canada confiscated people&#39;s money breaking international law.</b>  Rome enters a Country, exterminates, and keeps the remaining people&#39;s in refugee camps called Reserves.  Periodically they thin out the population.  They usually make a lot of noise about sport team names with Native names and how people are trying to erase their names, so as to hide the real erasure of actual peoples.  <b>Revelation 7:9, God says he would take out of all Nations and Tribes and Peoples a people for himself.  God accepts all those who accept him of all Nationalities.</b>  Donald J Trump started operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American people by military nurses.  Trump added death by electrocution, firing squad, poison gas to the already used lethal injection.   <b>Trump foretold war on Russia and China years in advance, a said no one would protect the Pope more than him.</b>  America turned it&#39;s back on God, so now he is turning his back on you.  <b>The US, Canada, Germany, Italy, Britain, Australia, Austria, Ukraine and many other Nations refused to agree and voted against a move at the United Nations to condemn Nazism.  Russia voted against Nazism.  Remember the Nazis?  They started WW2 and exterminated 12000000 human beings, often by extremely cruel means.  The Ukraine military has a entire Nazi battalion the Azov Nazi battalion.  Church leaders clearly seen in Hitler&#39;s Nazi SS footage blessing the troops before slaughters.  The Azov Steel Works was full of Nazis that surrendered to Russia, with pictures confirming their Nazi swastikas tattooed on their bodies.</b>  Ukraine banned all opposition parties and is trying to exterminate the Russian language, people and culture.  Teachers are sent to prison for teaching the Russian language in areas where most only speak Russian.  <b>Fighting for Democracy?</b>  Britain installed two Prime Ministers that were not elected.  <b>Donald J Trump used his office while President to start a business so called &quot;Truth Social&quot; that he claimed would enable free speech.  Later Mr.Trump tried to get the Justice department to stop late night hosts from talking about him.  So supposedly creating free speech over here, but attacking free speech over there.</b>  Russia and China no longer accept US fiat currency, so G7 banned Russian gold. Supposed unbiased media not allowing comments, is a mass deception and contrary to their purpose. CBDCs attacking crypto. 1933 the US confiscated gold.   For 50 years, 10 years in prison for having it, and only ended when gold was separated from backing money in 1971 now backed by cow farts. 2022 Biden bans Russian gold.  Military wearing US/UK flags in Ukraine. UK/Rome&#39;s &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;¬≤ ;+&#39;-&#39;&quot;",

10480,nEBVXO8xnFs,"I wonder if someone in a country like Venezuela were to watch this video, would they grasp what was explained about diversification and the details of how Dubai lured outside foreign companies to set up business there. What looks like a total lack of conditions imposed on these companies was actually what made this insane growth possible, and the government of Dubai look like economic geniuses. Of course they received a lot of negative criticism for the conditions of the imported labor used for construction, but most of those people were able to earn some money that they would not have gotten in their home country. So, nothing is perfect, and the end results were phenomenal. Good work, Dubai! üôè",

10493,nEBVXO8xnFs,"There is one major difference between India and Dubai, which makes such a model almost extremely risky to implement in India. The Population. In the early 70s Dubai had merely 70,000 inhabitants, while Mumbai had a population of 6.4Mn. At the same time, Dubai had enough oil reserves to distribute, contribute to the welfare of the 70k people and build infrastructure. Meanwhile, a city like Mumbai gets a much more expensive bill for social infrastructure maintenance and the majority of the city&#39;s income still comes from taxes. <br>Policy and strategy is extremely complex and multifaceted; many things become clearer in hindsight.",

10497,nEBVXO8xnFs,Pre 2014 Indian manufacturing was crippling because of all the blockades by left and congress by taking money from China. China&#39;s exponential growth is directly proportional to Indian manufacturing decline. Now we are emerging out because of manufacturing and exports. This is because of using the population we have.

You please approach Kerala with an open mind-without political bias, Kerala is surely a model. Especially for states with fragile economy. They Can learn a lot from Kerala how to deal with poverty / maintain democracy in  micro level, / Universal education with all modern amenities/fine System of healthcare right from Panchayats to Medical Colleges etc etc. Here we don&#39;t have any freebies. Only pension of Rs.1600 PM to aged people having no other Income. Even Congress or BJP never Say Pension is disbursed on political line ie only to party members No.. It is very transparent and eligibility is verified and scrutinised by ward level Peoples body- Jana Sabha - consisting of all party members. Since Kerala is higly populated and there is scarcity of Cultivable land Kerala Can&#39;t be governed by north Indian models. here Most of the families (consisting four members) own 3 to 10 Cents of land only. Nobody can own more than 15 acres. Can a N. Indian think of that. ? So Kerala is different from other part of India and hence it had to evolve its own system of Policies and governance. If you travel from South- Thiruvananthapuram to North-Kasaragod (560 KM ) you may think this state is a large metropolitan City. Not an inch of land without house/Shop. So only left leaning Policies and Interventions Can  Save Kerala. Please learn Kerala Independantly. Every Indian State Can emulate our de- Centralisation and peoples planning. These two helped us much to develop even our most interior/remote village. 3 o - 40% of total budget is allocated to Panchayaths. they decide how to Spend where to spend this money. Can you suppose in any other state where food packets Supply uninterreptedly during Covid Period. ? Not a Single man including millions of workers/daily labourers Coming from N. India faced hungry during those days. The best way to know about Kerala is your own brethren Who works and reside in Kerala. They are lakhs and lakhs. Many of the Poor employees from U P Bihar Bengal never want to return to their home state-because they feel they enjoy - what is security freedom Secularism absense of Jati / Caste. they are the best Source to learn about Kerala Thank you",

10733,yPo7mq27jEg,Well explained with facts. Populistic and free bees will ruin financials of India. There is need to create revenue than draining revenue to get power.,
10734,yPo7mq27jEg,"your presentation is great. Whatever govt does is dissastor and any govt scheme is loot. Unless govt also implements hire and fire for non performance what we save in pension scheme is lost and gone, though not in Rupees by calculation but by errosion of value of rupee drastically by high inflation and printing of notes.   For example I saved in PF 8 percent of my salary with 8 percent employee contribution for 30 long years..Now interest on that you got to day Rs 9000  which is taxed and actual value of of corpus is erorded by minimum 500 percent. Adaniis,Ambanis,Sighanias ,mallyas ,etc who are working on govt projects with our corpus funds  and with govt clout are billionaires and not employees even with 8 percent set aside.What you save for to morrow it is loot for corrupt and frauds ,  what you get is Peanuts  considering i hv contributed 8 percent of my earrning for 30 years . Please do not sugar coat and make any money  as subsidy given to poor and needy out of tax as sin.  This money belongs to public and from higher taxes paid by haves.T his is capitalistic propoganda by govt. Govt wants money to splurge and loot  with its financiers of its party. When man is starving to day you show him to morrow and take away his earnings. SUBSIDY TO HAVE NOTS BY TAXING HAVES IS NOT SIN. LET GOVT EFFCIENTLY COLLECT TAXES WITHOUT CORRUPTION .

Also government staff, many say, that they are already earning good salaries then why the need of pension?  So many peoples views and opinions are there on the net.

I bought these cars only for the emotional attachment to the name of Ratan Tata and the NCAP 5* rating. Tata definitely needs to upskill it&#39;s service teams big time.,

10960,WP0X1R_z7yI,"Tata vehicle&#39;s build quality and performance is awesome now. But the service is worst, which is a real concern for the customers. I own a nexon and its been 1.5 year and i&#39;m fed up with the service centre&#39;s unprofessional+ irresponsible attitude and service. This u will experience when u have any issue that needs expertise or warranty replacement required. Also i think plastic part&#39;s quality needs to be improved. Till i had such an experience i believed in performance, comfort and build quality. But after my service experience i learned service is much as important as whatever i had valued about a vehicle till that time. Worst service = unwanted mental stress, money waste, time waste. Out of 10 customers, who go for service,  7-8 people will get annoyed by the service. Even in waiting room other customers talks about their experience and issues after service. And these service centre guys are not all changing even after complaining to tata motors itself. One service centre guy told me like technicians and executives are not staying there for long, they will find another job after working sometime in these service centre&#39;s, so they mostly dont care. I  personally dont have any hope that their service will be better in any near future.on last service they told my vehicle&#39;s right door&#39;s wiring set needs to be replaced under warranty after 2-3 visits . Now its be 1.5 months, whenever i call them they tells me like part is not available. Will give a callback once it is available. The experience is from tata malayalam service centre kochi.",

In USA it is because they want to do wars all over the world. In case of China it is because of their insane &quot;civilian&quot; projects all over the continent. Yes OBOR, CPEC that nonsense.<br>Now when this starts to happen, the value of the currency starts to depreciate. Then country increases fed rates which causes recession - EXCEPT in secotrs shielded from foreign competition. Which in most countries is real estate. So while everything is regulating itself to fed rates, this bubble keeps growing until it bursts taking everything with it. That is what happened with USA and what is happened with CHina here. This crisis is also the reason most of CHina&#39;s international projects have not been completed either.<br><br>This is also precisely why we keep talking about resolving NPA&#39;s in India.

As long as people crave gold, the resources sunk into obtaining the metal can be recuperated, i.e, the investor does not lose the value irrespective of the usability of the metal. <br><br>With real estate in China, there are two points that you could have covered to give a bit more context:<br>a) There is no private property in China. Home owning implies the right to live/sell/lease the home for a period fixed by CCP (which is ~75 years right now). So, they NEVER own the asset fully...they only hold the rights to it for a fixed duration<br>b) Home prices are based on perceived value in the future based on demand rather than actual value.

11053,FxiZRYJTEo0,Ho will it affect Indian economy?,
11054,FxiZRYJTEo0,"One thing that I have noticed in all videos discussing China is that home buying is a mindless Social norm of China.<br><br>Its not a mindless social norm. Literally anything you want to get done here, you need Hukou for it. And Hukou is household registration booklet that you get when you buy property. If you dont buy property, its your parents Hukou that will be used and your parents may not have lived in cities.<br>Let me give you an example. If you want to send your kids to school, the only school the kids can attend is the one that is linked to their Hukou. As we all know that schools differ in the quality of education so if you want to send your kid to a good school, it is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL you buy property near that school. Without having a Hukuo near a school means your kid will never be able to attend it. <br>Secondly, this system suits the government, as not only does it allow the government to monitor their citizen movements (As if you live on rent somewhere for example, you need to be registered with the police) but it also brought the government a lot of revenue. By giving these lands to lease to these big developers. Infact it constituted 70% of the provincial revenues in some provinces and led to conflict of interest and losening of controls on construction.<br>There is another factor here. Unlike in democratic nations where popularity of the leader determines who rules, competence determines who rules or maintains rule in China. And one major way of demonstrating competence and getting promoted within the party is when you demonstrating high GDP growth as a ruler of a district or Municipality or City or province in China. And what better way to demonstrate GDP growth than by using construction? Bringing back to point 1 of this video.<br>There are deeper structural issues in how the system of China is set up that resulted in this crisis. But one thing you all indians and other youtubers making doomsday videos on China&#39;s economy need to understand. China is not shrinking. This video is weeks old and China still stands. Is peaceful, protests are no longer happening and things are under control. Situation is being fixed and it will be fixed. China is far stronger and more stable than what you give it credit for.",

11149,ON-vFJbq1Vc,"This is such a great video. It&#39;s interesting to see the thought process of these entrepreneurs. I was buying Zara womenswear extensively as they were very affordable, I can afford more items and the bright colours of the outfits while most of the other fashion retailers were playing safe with blue, grey, black, white, beige etc. I personally believe it&#39;s Zara who changed that and Brough more confidence to women when they were dressed in bold and bright colours and make them stand out from the crowd. Though the quality of their items are medium I still have a handful of items that have lasted over 5 years and still in a great condition. I have changed my strategy now. I&#39;ve reduced the number of items I buy and being very selective as well. I now mix and match Zara items with better quality and pricier pieces of clothing so it doesn&#39;t look like from Zara.",

Many argue that we have CEO like sundar pichai satya nadella but again Remember again they are just workers again and they can be replaced. Please revamp the engineering curriculum too dear central govt. And teachers is a big mess of india.

11233,cWsxSP3KGvs,YES.  NEP is a very good step towards progress though it is not perfect.,
11234,cWsxSP3KGvs,"A flaw  (in my opinion)  I want to adress about the current education policy is related to the completion of notebooks of every subject just for the sake of it . During exam time , this becomes hectic as all the students have to make sure they prepare well for the exams . But not a lot of us get to do that since we have this burden of completing never ending notebook work .<br>Sometimes it feels like we&#39;re not even studying to learn something . Because our teachers will hand out all these questions and worlkload tends to get a lot since a part of the portion of the syllabus is rushed during the last week before exams actually start .<br>There seems to be no benfit in just brainlessly copying questions and answers . It&#39;s not just me but my fellow classmates too who I&#39;ve seen spend hours on completing the same .<br>The completion of this notebook thing is damaging and time consuming for us students .",

11270,cWsxSP3KGvs,I appreciate your analysis . As a teacher I consider myself good but the even the college education where I teach is designed by University which has no practical applications. So why blame the British . They taught us English which has made us relevant in many countries. Blame the government which sat ducks  on an education system with no direction or vision. The teacher has no say in matters here as to what must be taught and how. We must look at the positives not negatives. The real question is how long are we taking to design our curriculum to s relavant model and how. This applies a cross every aspect of our education. No teacher participation in curriculum formation and mo broad vision. It&#39;s time we realize science and arts are not wo tight compartments. Google was designed by the tech and an artist after all.,

11272,cWsxSP3KGvs,Only children born with good IQ make  it to the mark &amp; become Sundar Pichais ..but majority don&#39;t because of Indian education policy based on Orthodox British education system which was meant to produce  only office clerks.  <br>So when will Indian education policy produce a million sundar Pichais ? <br><br>First thing the NEP should enforce is that no Home-work should be forced on children because of which children spend hours  just  to copy paste &amp;  somehow submit the homework &amp;  after school hours let&#39;s say  if there is  homework even for just  6 subjects then a student spends minimum 6  to 9 hours in just writing &amp; filling pages  of  book  without reading or understanding the subject matter &amp; this is the reason most students are not sucucesfull in the later part of their life . and then we say when will India have a Microsoft or a Tesla or a Google.  India does not have a Elon musk or a Bill gates etc because  Indian education encouragees Mug-up culture and are producing crores  &amp; crores of  non thinkers who may pass university  exams but miserably fail  in competative entrance exams.  Why? Because Indian education only suits or is meant for children born with good or high IQ but what about the rest.  ?<br><br>Moreover since the student spends  many hours in  just  filling pages without reading the subject as the student does not get time plus because the student spends all his or her after  school-hours  time in non productive homework so the student does not get time to play or engage in extra circular activities.<br> So as a nation what kind of youth are we producing . As a nation India is producing non-productive..non physically fit youth who cannot compete  &amp; such a non competative youth population  start  taking  short cuts and so compromise on merrit &amp; so India has become a nation of non meritorious population &amp;  how can such a indian society  of non-meritorious   citizens    create a positive &amp; secure future for India.   This vicious cycle which is the DNA of the current  Indian education system must be broken to produce not a few sundar Pichais or Satya nadellas  but India needs a million sundar pichais..&amp; satya nadellas &amp; Vishwanathan  anand  else India will be a slave nation dependent on other nations just  to survive but not to prosper.,

11277,cWsxSP3KGvs,"this is my scepticism towards the new education policy. the target of this policy on gross enrollment ratio in higher education is 50% whereas the present national average is 25<br>the highest score in this category is Tamil Nadu in the largest States which is already more than aspirational target of this policy. But the present new education policy is  contradictory to the goal of gross enrollment ratio in many ways. to improve the gross enrollment affordability and accessibility to the education is must which is curtailed by this policy and badly affect the poor people. of course to improve the nation  this kind of policy is essential but it should not marginalise the rights of poor people, so it should not be applied universally. the centre and states which has poor gross enrollment ratio would look deeper into the Tamil Nadu model to get benefited.",

11296,cWsxSP3KGvs,India needs education revolution.  Just end exam oriented approach and other things will fall in place. New education policy really looks game changer. excited,
11297,cWsxSP3KGvs,"A totally wrong analysis. Absolutely rubbish. This video is just a summary of various WhatsApp messages.<br>For example, the opinion that schools are designed to function like factories to find manpower for the factories is fundamentally incorrect. Obviously this channel has NO f**king insight into the fundamentals of pedagogy.<br>Indians have this thing where they blame all the evils of their education system on Macaulay. Can there be a more narcissistic behaviour??!!<br>Now, coming to the NEP, it is an eyewash. There are NO revolutionary or even distinguishing features of the new NEP. Let me elaborate...<br>First, the date of compliance for complete implementation of the NEP is 2040. Get that??!! 20 years. A policy that will be fully implemented only after 20 years, is a failure in whatever it plans to achieve.<br>&quot;PhD professors cannot teach&quot; is the gem regurgitated by the speaker. This sensational claim is NOT from any formal study. It&#39;s just his impression. And it&#39;s wrong on so many levels.<br>The NEP has focused on making &quot;coding&quot; an essential subject from grade 9 onwards. Coding was relevant in 2000-2010. That&#39;s when all the major companies of today came into existence. It&#39;s foolhardy to even assume that the same environment will exist in 2040 and that coding is relevant for the future world. The most stupid decision ever taken in education policy.<br>Also, there is NO attempt in the NEP to reduce the burden on today&#39;s students, make educational institutions more accountable, give more power to the students and their parents or to prepare the students for a world of 20 years from today.<br>There is no revamp of the curriculum except stupid exclusions of Muslim rulers from some texts.<br>There is NO integration of either the industry or the society with the education system, which BTW existed in the traditional gurukul systems.<br>In all, the NEP is the biggest eyewash lemon sold to the Indian populous in the form of redeeming set of changes. There is nothing of substance and shows the inability of Indians to properly upgrade their future generations.<br>To the people running this channel, I am starting to get the impression that your a mouthpiece for the ruling government. In any case, your biased, uninformed take on this and several other issues is doing a great disservice to the nation.<br>I know that you have to earn a living and have to have a job. But doing so by sacrificing future generations is NOT the way to go. If you do these things because you honestly believe in them, then your beyond redemption.<br>All I can say is, please do proper research before churning out filth like this on your channel. If India is to survive, then we HAVE to recognise &amp; accept our shortcomings and take action accordingly.<br>And we don&#39;t have a lot of time. The next 10 years make or break this country.<br>The first step to solve any problem is to admit that there is one.",
11298,cWsxSP3KGvs,So true about teachers..Specially the Phd once...Literally they know nothing about teaching ...,

11310,tgFEFEOisAI,"<b>History repeating like during WW2 and WW1/Spanish plague.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now under WW3 and a corona virus pandemic. Hitler used Zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the fumant removed.  It causes symptoms like corona virus.  Look up in the sky you will see planes spraying your cities!  Hitler attacked Russia, just like what is happening now.  The British Empire had no legal male Heir so they imported a fake one from Germany.  The British Queen&#39;s husband &quot;Prince Philip&quot; renounced his German citizenship, became a Greek citizen and as a Greek citizen moved to Britain gaining citizenship there.  After gaining citizenship, he was appointed a Duke, out of thin air and then as a Prince and married Queen Elizabeth.  &quot;Prince Philip&quot; took the name of the Queen, not the other way, as it usually is done, where a wife takes the husband&#39;s name.  The British Empire has run out of male Heirs at least twice, and they kill to suppress it.    WW2 was a way of hiding this fraud, and now WW3 is a way of hiding that illegal combines Heir. The Bible says that a male would not fail to sit on the throne.  A family name continues through the males, not the females, and Philip was a fraud.  He had become a Greek citizen to make it appear that he was a Royal from the earlier Greek dynasty.</b>  Total theater.  <b>The Catholic Empires of the Roman Empire form one leg and the UK(British controlled) Empire forms the other leg of the Roman Empire, with the King Pope Francis as the ruler of the whole system.  He has a triple teired crown with 666 on it in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  He is a King of the city state of the Vatican(the Vatican is the smallest Country in the world), Rome Italy, and is mentioned in Revelation, Apocalypse, 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions that this Empire is responsible for all those slaughtered on earth.  It mention what the leaders wear, which is scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  The UK leg Royals also wear those colors, a long with Judges and Magistrates of the Crown.  They refer to this entity as the Crown.  When some one goes to court in one of the British subservient Nations, it is said that the Crown has a case against the person.</b>  Canada, Australian and others are not sovereign or free.  please read Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, and study it closely, because this Empire comes as a false system claiming to represent God, but exterminates to stay in power.  <b>1Timothy3:1-16 mentions that the one looking after a group(Church) should be a husband of one wife with obedient children.  The Pope and the Priests of the Catholic Church are forbidden to marry, and so don&#39;t even qualify, according to the very book and God they say they claim to represent(an unmarried man has no wife or children.)   The Bible&#39;s Peter&#39;s mother in-law was cured by Jesus(Yeshua).  So if Peter had a mother in law, then he had a wife as there is no other way.</b>  That is why Catholic Priest have sex with so many little boys, girls and women attendees.  <b>There was over ninety cases of Preists molesting little boys in the city of Boston, USA alone.  None of the Priests were disciplined, but were only moved to a different location, and now you know why.  The whole system is a fraud.</b>  So this organization has many false teachings.  <b>The Roman Emporer forced a combining of Biblical and Pagan beliefs, when Rome Nationalized the Church.  Rome forbid the celebration of Biblical Holy days and Sabbaths under threat of beatings, then confiscation of property and finally death.   Many beheaded or burned alive.</b>  Revelation Apocalypse 18:4 says get out of this organization &quot;my people&quot; if you don&#39;t want to receive her plagues.  <b>Freedom to communicate is under attack by Church and State, up to the point they are threatening to bomb the microprocessor production facilities.</b>  Pray for me and you, please!  <b>Russia says they have the proof that Britain was involved in at least thres major terror attacks against Russia.</b>  Would Russia bomb their own 5+ Billion pipeline, their own bridge, powerplants and Navel yards?  <b>NATO said that they would attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize their island, because Australia would feel threatened, but NATO was militarizing Ukraine, where they had bunkers full of weapons.  NATO&#39;s puppet regime in Ukraine was banning the Russian language and culture even though that was many people&#39;s only language.  The Ukrainian Capital is a Russian word until Western media changed it to hide the Russian history, as Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a recent NATO coup, which the US planned, as they told their dignitaries not to attend the Russian Olympics at that time. You could go to prison for teaching the Russian language. All opposition parties in Ukraine (banned).  Those with out blue arm bands(now yellow?) being put to death.</b>  Many US Officials had been talking about a coming war with Russia and China.  Years in advance.  <b>Donald J Trump said he couldn&#39;t answer corona virus questions claiming we are at war.</b>  Trump said that the US will soon be at war with Russia and China. <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, but are part of China, as acknowledged by most nations of the world till recently.</b>  NATO is planning to do to Taiwan and China what they did to Ukraine and Russia.  <b>Britain fighting for Democracy in Ukraine?  Britain has had two or three Prime Ministers that have not been ellected, trying to help the naked Emporer.</b>  Think!  <b>Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband&#39;s attack is a fraud.  The Police changed and contradicted the events multiple times and it makes no sense.</b>  Corona virus is a code name for information that exposes the crown(Government/Royals).  A vaccine is computer/electronic device program that deletes information from your view(anti virus software).  Symptoms for a biological virus comes from being gased, radiated or sprayed in your environment.  <b>Planes fly in parallel patterns, causing heating of your environment and breathing difficulties.  Like Hitler killed by Zyklon B gas, so now they use a deadly gas in incubators.</b>  Donald J Trump said he would put Hilary R Clinton in prison when ellected for starting a war and genocide in Libya, but when he got in power did nothing.  Americans have started many unjust wars.  <b>America/NATO is about to start wars with Ethiopia, Haiti, Taiwan, Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the list goes on.  NATO Countries have invaded more than half of all sovereign Nations on earth, in the last 30 years.</b>  When you print money on paper and then go buy things with it, and it is not backed by any thing then you have to attack a lot of people to keep the scheme going.  <b>New Central Bank digital currencies(CBDCs) will be centralized and backed only by cow farts and trust, where as Bitcoin is decentralized and backed by gold.  Bitcoin/gold and silver came under a major attack by the crown(governments).  The digital currencies will create a M.O.B. type system, that if you get in government cross hairs you will be shut out of the system just like Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Russia and so on and so on.  If they do it to a complete Country, then they will have no problem doing it to individuals.  Canada confiscated people&#39;s money breaking international law.</b>  Rome enters a Country, exterminates, and keeps the remaining people&#39;s in refugee camps called Reserves.  Periodically they thin out the population.  They usually make a lot of noise about sport team names with Native names and how people are trying to erase their names, so as to hide the real erasure of actual peoples.  <b>Revelation 7:9, God says he would take out of all Nations and Tribes and Peoples a people for himself.  God accepts all those who accept him of all Nationalities.</b>  Donald J Trump started operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American people by military nurses.  Trump added death by electrocution, firing squad, poison gas to the already used lethal injection.   <b>Trump foretold war on Russia and China years in advance, a said no one would protect the Pope more than him.</b>  America turned it&#39;s back on God, so now he is turning his back on you.  <b>The US, Canada, Germany, Italy, Britain, Australia, Austria, Ukraine and many other Nations refused to agree and voted against a move at the United Nations to condemn Nazism.  Russia voted against Nazism.  Remember the Nazis?  They started WW2 and exterminated 12000000 human beings, often by extremely cruel means.  The Ukraine military has a entire Nazi battalion the Azov Nazi battalion.  Church leaders clearly seen in Hitler&#39;s Nazi SS footage blessing the troops before slaughters.  The Azov Steel Works was full of Nazis that surrendered to Russia, with pictures confirming their Nazi swastikas tattooed on their bodies.</b>  Ukraine banned all opposition parties and is trying to exterminate the Russian language, people and culture.  Teachers are sent to prison for teaching the Russian language in areas where most only speak Russian.  <b>Fighting for Democracy?</b>  Britain installed two Prime Ministers that were not elected.  <b>Donald J Trump used his office while President to start a business so called &quot;Truth Social&quot; that he claimed would enable free speech.  Later Mr.Trump tried to get the Justice department to stop late night hosts from talking about him.  So supposedly creating free speech over here, but attacking free speech over there.</b>  Russia and China no longer accept US fiat currency, so G7 banned Russian gold. Supposed unbiased media not allowing comments, is a mass deception and contrary to their purpose. CBDCs attacking crypto. 1933 the US confiscated gold.   For 50 years, 10 years in prison for having it, and only ended when gold was separated from backing money in 1971 now backed by cow farts. 2022 Biden bans Russian gold.

11350,tgFEFEOisAI,THE WAR WILL HAPPEN!!! The only reason it has not yet is because China is not sure they will win. That is why they are so hard at work building new military capabilities. I hardly think China will invade within the next 5 to 10 years.,

11368,tgFEFEOisAI,"The UNO decided decades ago that under the Resolution No 2758 there is only one representation of the Chinese people, and this would be under Mainland China. But this resolution is only applicable for UNO-Members. Taiwan is no UN-Member, so this resolution is illegal and not applicable for Taiwan. And because the gouvernment of Xi Jinping knows that, they are opening the hell if they do not get the ressouces of the sea and the IT technology they want by the sinification of Taiwan.<br><br>The rule of the Chinese government is never a peaceful way, but a history of brutal force, power, agression, terror and all means to achieve the goal of power. Countries are invaded, ethnic tribes are infiltrated by the Han majority, languages and script systems are forcefully replaced. This is the true history of China, and will always be. The sooner people, states, countries and ethnic tribes will learn this, the better for them. The whole world is waiting for a better, more human China and foreign policy example. But until now it is not happening. Until now all they do is to apply brutal force over worldwide people. Where are the good Chinese people which could change this policy? The are not in power, but should get in power.",

11376,tgFEFEOisAI,Can you share some research on the future of Nepal and Bhutan with the growing expansion and rise of China (China has already come inward to Bhutan and part of Nepal) and India&#39;s position? Either poking into Bhutan or part of India will be first than Taiwan to keep India busy and engaged. Anything on this growth?,

11378,tgFEFEOisAI,Bro you make learning about these topics so fun that I WANT to do the homework lmao.,
11379,tgFEFEOisAI,Absolute rubbish spiced up with western-aligned propaganda as expected which is expected from this channel.<br>Channels who advertise on behalf of their &#39;sponsors&#39; in each post are not objective.<br>Unfortunately there&#39;s millions who subscribe to these kind of anti-China and anti- Russia feeds.,

11386,tgFEFEOisAI,its same with ukraine and russia amerika/nato wants to take the lands but russia and china will never give away there lands,
11387,tgFEFEOisAI,We been in World War 3,

11389,tgFEFEOisAI,‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üá¶,
11390,tgFEFEOisAI,Hawaii idealy should not be one of the USA and I might not agree with imperialism but I also recognise it would not be good for the ballance of power if China decided to start doing what the USA is doing in both Taiwan and Ukraine and therefor America needs to stop this now because allthough China are known for playing the long game they will not allow NATO or any other so called mediator driven by the USA imperialism and when you have the likes of war monger Kissinger advising against it you know something is very wrong in our so called democracy,
11391,tgFEFEOisAI,China are simply not prepared for war. They have 0 war experience. America have gone to war in the last 20 years with almost every country in Africa and the middle east. To close the gap China must bomb Isis or the Taliban their weapons are untested too. If America and China went to war China will lose cos America have more experience.,
11392,tgFEFEOisAI,"Besides trade secret transfership, you missed the 4th main reason why they want Taiwan: for cultural reasons.<br><br>&quot;Most important part of the video = how it affects India&quot; (or, the rest of the world, you mean?) Sounds a little ethnocentric. We&#39;re all part of the same family and in this together. We should seek for peace throughout all and strive to alleviate human suffering.",

11510,HFzSK32G4OU,WHICH MIC HAVE U USED IN THIS VIDEO?,
11511,HFzSK32G4OU,Nice thumbnail,
11512,HFzSK32G4OU,"Usually, I like your content but this one has a lot of conjecture. <br>YouTube &amp; YouTube Music are two different apps altogether. YouTube may help you to redirect from a video to its audio platform but that music app still takes up a very very small portion of the market share as compared to Spotify.<br>It wouldn&#39;t matter therefore even if podcasts come under the same umbrella since it is immensely difficult to move a user loyalty from one music app to another unless there is a drastic difference in the offerings.<br><br>They might just end up coexisting.",

11530,HFzSK32G4OU,Good case study. Apple music is available for Android also. Nothing is free with Apple.,
11531,HFzSK32G4OU,"YouTube Premium is way better, we gets YouTube ad-free, background play and picture-in-picture playing along with YT music premium. Both at the cost of one Spotify subscription. Also suggestions and recommendations for music on YT music is as same as Spotify.",
11532,HFzSK32G4OU,RIP Google music,
11533,HFzSK32G4OU,"I&#39;m a DJ i have used almost all music streaming platform, music apps, music softwares etc.<br>Spotify is best platform. It pays less agree but other platforms too pay less. <br>That&#39;s why music streaming is not a guaranteed income source for Musicians.",
11534,HFzSK32G4OU,Youtube has some exclusive collection of music available nowhere else. I have the premium subscription of Youtube and I watch most of this channel&#39;s videos as a podcast by switching off the screen.,
11535,HFzSK32G4OU,That&#39;s why they collabed with Netflix to make the Shows and Movies Albums Spotify exclusive!<br>Just like Apple is doing with Apple TV+ contents on Apple Music,
11536,HFzSK32G4OU,"Apple Music for Apple users only? Dude do you even do your research? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFzSK32G4OU&amp;t=8m08s"">8:08</a>",

11540,HFzSK32G4OU,why don&#39;t you talk in hindi?,
11541,HFzSK32G4OU,I would prefer Spotify over Youtube Music because of the quality of ads. Sometimes there are 10 min long ads. There is not background playing ability. It just feels so bad.,
11542,HFzSK32G4OU,"Thanks to YT&#39;s algorithm, Think School&#39;s videos keep popping up in my suggestions and boy, am I so eager to lap them up! Love your videos as always boss! üëåüèºüëåüèº",

11545,HFzSK32G4OU,Where&#39;s Amazon music,
11546,HFzSK32G4OU,"I disagree that Yt music will come out a winner. I am a premium member of YouTube. The music quality and app experience are abysmal. <br>All the audiophiles prefer Spotify -&gt; Apple Music -&gt; Yt Music.  Apple music shines in ecosys, especially with AirpodsPro.<br>All the YT premium subscribers take the subscription for ad-free video experience, not for the music experience.<br>And Google has a history of killing off its apps.",

11550,HFzSK32G4OU,ngl thumbnail caught me,
11551,HFzSK32G4OU,Good video. I think it would have been nice to mention how many billion dollars Apple made in iPods,
11552,HFzSK32G4OU,Whole Spotify-Joe Rogan fiasco and Apple Music engaging in a bit of trolling would make for a great part 2 in coming months we just don&#39;t know whats gonna happen currently maybe if some big artist pulls their music it&#39;ll be very interesting nonetheless.,
11553,HFzSK32G4OU,Great,
11554,HFzSK32G4OU,"The comparison between Apple music and other music apps is wrong and illogical. Apple music is strictly only for Apple users and rest all apps are for every user. <br>By a far margin, Apple music is the best music app in the world currently in terms of audio output and quality! Apple music is cheaper than Spotify and many other apps but provides best quality audio among all other apps.",
11555,HFzSK32G4OU,"There&#39;s a big issue you did not even touch, and that is yes Napster did change consumer behaviour but the wide scale change was with YouTube.

They are taught from childhood that secularism is good(even though I don&#39;t feel it to be good) but as an experimental approach I think income of liberals and leftists is more.....

11706,LwnApD9YXNY,RBI never stopped BNPL they just wants no BNPL fintech top up prepaid card with credit limit. Thats all.,
11707,LwnApD9YXNY,"Loved it how the topic he has chosen is all about risk of debt, and then he advertises Cred&#39;s personal loan feature!",

11710,LwnApD9YXNY,Everything is fake,
11711,LwnApD9YXNY,Talking about debt trap but promoting 9% interest rates of Cred Mint.. ironical!,
11712,LwnApD9YXNY,thanks to rbi we would be doomed like usa....,
11713,LwnApD9YXNY,"Thanks for making great videos as always.<br>I would avoid using CRED app to be part of paid member only community. When life is simpler, its better. Whenever I use my credit card, I pay immediately from my bank account so I don&#39;t have to remember making card payment and also get 2 to 3% cashback every month. Direct cash back is much better than earning points. With points you are trapped into buying something.",
11714,LwnApD9YXNY,"The problem starts when you are able to afford a 5k product virtually and not in reality. 1k or 2k EMI  might sound reasonable, but thinking of this every month gonna put you into serious trouble.",
11715,LwnApD9YXNY,Very good message in the end..,
11716,LwnApD9YXNY,These cards were providing so good features previously. I don&#39;t understand why we should suffer for the irresponsible people. <br>I had credit cards but still I used to use slice as it had so much good features but not anymore,
11717,LwnApD9YXNY,"Dude if convenience fees are the real issue here then why not put caps on those (from 25% to 2-4%). Moreover, I think this BNPL gives a small allounce like 2-8k (Amazon and Flipkart pay later services) will prepare youth to handle credit cards when they&#39;re eligible, it&#39;s not like giving them 30k credit while being unemployed.",
11718,LwnApD9YXNY,The big question is how do these companies handle the loan defaults??,
11719,LwnApD9YXNY,This was your first video which actually felt shit man. For some reason in your quest not to make rbi look silly you decided to say that people don‚Äôt deserve credit. That‚Äôs for the consumer and company to decide. Not rbi or you. <br><br>The fact that people are not using it responsibly and need to do that is an awareness or regulatory problem. Not one where this product it self should be retired.,

11721,LwnApD9YXNY,slice removed 3 months split and pay(without interest),

11723,LwnApD9YXNY,good move,
11724,LwnApD9YXNY,Credit Card is a depth trap imo. I&#39;ve seen well to do rich individuals getting addicted to it and destroying their lives.,
11725,LwnApD9YXNY,Bnpl is every country so we came to know it&#39;s dark side...but UPI is only in india....we will see it&#39;s dark side soon..,
11726,LwnApD9YXNY,yes they charge too much. zest charges 36% interest,

11730,LwnApD9YXNY,"Oh c&#39;mon, BNPL is a boon for people like me. I use Amazon pay later. I do not spend money on unnecesary stuff. I only spend on things which are super important to me like bill payments, recharges, and products which are less than 2k. I always pay on time and it has been super beneficial to me since they doesn&#39;t charge me <br>even 1% of interests",
11731,LwnApD9YXNY,Companies are making profits forcefully with this.. final consumers end up paying more!! Rich are becoming more rich!! Not sure what is amazing about this idea!!,
11732,LwnApD9YXNY,I knew that,
11733,LwnApD9YXNY,The temptation to buy anything is far too great. One could find himself in a financial trap. The interest is a monster.,
11734,LwnApD9YXNY,Good thing rbi taken fineteck company&#39;s should be baned for collection high interest,
11735,LwnApD9YXNY,the problem is that people who are irresponsible will screw up a regular credit card too.,
11736,LwnApD9YXNY,I use Cred from last 2 years. The best option for emergency loans as interest rate is very low &amp; it is credited into your account in less than 2 mins.,
11737,LwnApD9YXNY,DO NOT get Slice card!! The 3 months interest free option is no longer available! And they charge 36% interest after one month!,
11738,LwnApD9YXNY,Debit card is the best. It keeps us middle class in check and reality.,

11744,LwnApD9YXNY,"I have been using BNPL for the last three months and I am already realising the mistake that i have made. We don&#39;t tend to understand the trap until we are deeply stuck in it. That being said, thanks a lot to this video. The next few months are going to be tough but at the end of it all, if I am able to reduce even 20% of my debt, I&#39;d consider it a success.",
11745,LwnApD9YXNY,It is a good move by RBI before things get out of control.,
11746,LwnApD9YXNY,The worst thing they will call u 27/7 unlimited call until u pay. <br><br>But bank credit card teams they don&#39;t call unlimited times in a day,

Not advisable...RBI shld  actually work on lowering the lending rates and do controlled lending only.",

11753,LwnApD9YXNY,Great bro ‚ù£Ô∏è thanks,
11754,LwnApD9YXNY,Most of the time the BNPL service provider call you before your due date and remind about the payment and is the person doesn&#39;t pay even after that then screw him and yea your should use the service cautiously as to how much you earn and how much you spend and always pay on time but just because of the negligence and irresponsible people out there the service should not be stopped. Their are many who are really in need of it. Cheers,
11755,LwnApD9YXNY,"What I have learnt from using Slice is that you&#39;ll have a thought that you can buy anything you want because you have slice. However, the more you use it, the more easier it becomes to buy stuff you do not need. However, i somehow managed to pull back the spendings. Also, I always stay at least one month ahead in my payments because of how my salary is credited on 10th instead of 1st and the Slice payment due date is 5th of every month. I really love slice. However, so need to be careful of how we use it because it can be very dangerous if used irresponsibility.",

11769,LwnApD9YXNY,"CRED sponsored this video ü§£ hence the anti BNPL proganda.  <br>Like credit cards, BNPL requires financial maturity. You see the average American drowning in debt when credit advanced is large. BNPL must limit itself to under $100-150 per customer.",
11770,LwnApD9YXNY,"I have a question, as a credit card issuance it is completely dependent on some external income plus multiple factors. Are they equally damaging as BNPL services, if we say that these services are now easily offered to people below 25 or the same customer who were BNPL consumer as that of BNPL services?",
11771,LwnApD9YXNY,Indian education system really needs a subject related to tax and finance. The amount of financial illiteracy we have is astonishing.

11788,LwnApD9YXNY,"RBI should also impose BNPL on the sector of House Loans or Plot Loans with Minimum Limit INR 20 Lacs and Max Limit INR 5 Crs Specially for Serviced Personnels (both private &amp; Govt Sect) because after all who needs Personal Loans with Minimum Limit and higher Interest Rates.

11900,sZmNdXZjKgs,"It is very interesting to see many videos saying UPI is free while not talking about hidden taxes in place of MDR. Remember all merchant transactions still have some type of GST associated with them some as high as 18%.  Since merchants for larger stores cannot assume VISA/MC cards won&#39;t come from tourists, in order to keep things even, they add the MDR costs of all card services to the base price ahead of time. So when we say 0% MDR due to RuPay or UPI, that saving of 2-3% actually goes to the merchant as extra income. In any case, customer is paying the MDR out of their pocket whether the payment platform is UPI or VISA/MC network.",
11901,sZmNdXZjKgs,Don&#39;t we still need our card details to use UPI   ? ü§®,
11902,sZmNdXZjKgs,However in Houston we use a Debit card. The  card is linked to my Security Card (Social Security is our retirement Card.,

11909,sZmNdXZjKgs,Again this guy is one sided. Government will kill Visa and MasterCard. Then UPI can change nominal fees. Due to transaction volume it will be a win win situation,
11910,sZmNdXZjKgs,I remember UPA government introduce the rupay debit cards avoid chergs from other countries cards like Visa Mastercard etc in that time banks replace the cards with rupay debit cards.. after 2014 govt changed.. Rupay debit cards replaced with Visa Mastercard cards...in earlier days if we needs ATM card go to the bank pay 250 rupees apply for card.. now banks directly send Visa Mastercard ATM cards without our permission and amount debited from account automatically....

It&#39;s when videos like these summarise things so wonderfully, you can see what an incredible turn around our country has made within 75 years of Independence. The generation born right before 1947 is very much alive at this point and gets to witness India&#39;s days of post Independence poverty and struggle to becoming a direct competitor to the west.

11927,sZmNdXZjKgs,Excellent step by Indian Government. They should extend UPI to other countries too.,
11928,sZmNdXZjKgs,"The coolest part is Govt is not nationalizing the payment market. They are creating 100x superior product. Kinda like what Uber did to Taxis. One more amazing part to observe is that currently credit cards are only held by the &#39;rich&#39; but if you make MDR == 0 &amp; predatory credit card practices are removed, the market will expand. You&#39;ll have way more people switching to credit cards. Then as he wonderfully put credit cards would become micro-financing.",

11939,sZmNdXZjKgs,3percent charge for transfer is definitely too much for Indian middle and lower class.maybe the government giving the charge to more local companies similar to visa and master card would cost less or be no charge as Indian lower and middle class can&#39;t afford 3 percent,

11945,sZmNdXZjKgs,Lmao these sanghi clowns and their fantasies ü§£ü§£ü§£,
11946,sZmNdXZjKgs,One point I want to add is that where amount of spending is more people tend to use credit cards even if they have balance in sb account to take advantage of credit period while balance in sb keeps earning interest till due date of payment of credit card bill. That&#39;s what I do. As such you can&#39;t classify users as rich or poor based on card usage. I also want to state that within GCC countries it&#39;s compulsory that the transactions are carried out on GCC payment gateway. If the transaction is outside GCC then only visa or master card come into picture. Similarly government can make use of Rupay gateway compulsory for all domestic transactions. Note: That doesn&#39;t mean I am a rich man.,

11951,sZmNdXZjKgs,"Excellent content as always - 2 thoughts for your consideration. <br>1st: I typically spend greater than 50000 / month on CC and don‚Äôt use DC (I use my SB while making UPI payments) so that I can use that money for my Equity Investments. I haven‚Äôt defaulted ever on CC payments. So being rich and poor doesn‚Äôt necessarily link to usage of CC and DC. I have family / friends who don‚Äôt want the hassle of remembering CC payment schedules etc and chose DB. <br>2nd: Although I don‚Äôt care if Visa and MC loose business, because I believe with our strong systems we can survive without them, what if Government only allows charging Interchange Fee only and absorbs Switching Fee, would the concerns get addressed? Thoughts?",

11953,sZmNdXZjKgs,Big fan of your videos! Amazing content.,
11954,sZmNdXZjKgs,"Two contradictions from my side,<br>1. Even with current setup the credit risks are borne by the banks and not by Visa or Mastercard. So, no new risk need to be taken by UPI by enabling credit payments <br>2. Whether low or premium payments, government can now stop siphoning of funds in the name of MDR by Visa/Mastercard and also comes with huge leverage if a low MDR is charged by Govt. UPI can be made as huge profitable program ..",
11955,sZmNdXZjKgs,"I told my friend one year back Indian has powerful system of UPI can sell this technology to other countries to the world and gain value and cross boarder payment easily. Now, india moving in that way.",
11956,sZmNdXZjKgs,India dominates the world in UPI. if other countries demand indias upi. Indian currency will rule over the world,
11957,sZmNdXZjKgs,ü§ë,
11958,sZmNdXZjKgs,"Dude VISA doesn‚Äôt take credit risk.  Transaction fees has nothing to do with credit risk.  Credit risk is borne by the issuing bank and it makes it up by charging you higher interest rate if u don‚Äôt make ur monthly <a href=""http://payment.credit/"">payment.credit</a> cards are very highly profitable business. vISA is a network monopoly intermediary and they can be only be replaced by such an  entity like govt of India",

11963,sZmNdXZjKgs,"Thanks for the nice information. One point to your analysis, those who own both credit and debit cards, having capability to pay money instantly, still prefer to use the credit cards.

11965,sZmNdXZjKgs,stop with sound backwound!!!!,
11966,sZmNdXZjKgs,"What the hell? Since rupay is the instrument to compete with visa and MC, they should just eliminate switching fee while leaving interchange fee on its own. That way you don&#39;t infringe on something you don&#39;t control. Govt doesn&#39;t need to compensate for losses incurred by issuing bank. UPI is just a mode/ network",

11977,sZmNdXZjKgs,No MDR means no Rewards or credit points and no offers or extra benefits from credit card companies.,
11978,sZmNdXZjKgs,Here comes the master stroke of charging for every transaction. This will be the end/decline of UPI.,

11987,sZmNdXZjKgs,Credit card comes with the credit limit set by the bank. And bank would do its credit risk assessment before giving the revolving credit limit. So I am not sure how you are saying that adding a fee will reduce the credit risk. And secondly the credit transaction market being that larger the merchant are loosing money paying the mdr. Last but not the least using a credit card gives you insurance against fraud. Where in debit card do not have that insurance protection.,

The US, portugese , france, all left the colonies because of netaji or it was all part of decolnization process. <br>He was no super man military leader who was to defeat to the British India army of the Allied offensive, the INA was moslty an irregular milita with little or no war expertise this was ww2 not some random skirmish.  <br>A regiment of women may sound inspiring but only a fool would use them in direct battle in 1940s.<br>Coming to naval mutiny andRed fort trials, the revolts primarily started because of bad reparations paid to the navy post the war for multitude of reasons.

12323,nnwqtZiYMxQ,"I live Mumbai, but, when I came here, about 3 years ago, we started to buy Amul not knowing that the competition was selling far good quality milk at the same price. Previously, I resided in Akola, Maharashtra, where Aarey was selling the same quality milk at 1/2 the rate. So, Amul is just exhausting it&#39;s customers money, and making huge profits by making low quality products.",
12324,nnwqtZiYMxQ,"Amul might be doing good business, but the quality of milk has been continuously worsening. Like here, I live in Mumbai City (District) and the the milk I bought is Amul Taaza (toned). The MRP for the packet of 1/2 litres is 26  but the shopkeepers sell it at 27, some selling for 28 or even 29 rs. And the milk is so thin that it is easily comparable to water. Then, I started buying some alternatives and they offer far superior quality compared to Amul and that too at the same price. So, I request to Amul management team to mind the quality of their products, too.",

12342,nnwqtZiYMxQ,Everything is good...but in lockdown my company which supplies loose and Freshly milked A2 milk increased its volume  hugely as people become more aware about processing industry and moved from packet milk to fresh milk. You may be right on other facts but health benefits on packet milk that&#39;s a question mark. Processing industry can never make a product more healthy. Our traditional way is alwayd better. And I have noticed in bangalore more loose milk seller selling milk after I came in here since last 3 yrs. And all these happened during lockdown. Yes in only smaller area of Bangalore where we supply our dairy products...But this can happen anywhere around the world....,

12399,nnwqtZiYMxQ,the video is irrelevant and read news for some knowledge,
12400,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Excellent video. Two points: 1. Contract farming could still be exploitive as the farmer bears the risk of reduced production and yet selling at lower than market price. During surplus production, &#39;quality&#39; clause is loophole that could be exploited by the buyers to avoid buying all the produce the farmer makes. 2. The lack of legal validity of MSP was supposed to be counterbalanced by a govt buyer, the Food Corporation of India which is assured to be outside Cartals because it is not a private entity. The concept of Govt owned corporation to break monopolies or cartels is used in some countries eg France and is anathema in others eg USA. India belonged to former group with companies like BSNL, FCI, AI etc existing to prevent monopoly and cartelization. The current govt seems  ideologically inclined towards dismantling this model.",

12423,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Stop that background music man.,
12424,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Wow. First video that helped me understand the importance of the issue.,
12425,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Contract Farming is a norm in the livestock development, at least in Poultry. It happens without any regulation, and they are actually protected to some extent.",
12426,76w6GQ1vs1Y,I am also a Farmer in Maharashtra...and Here is no compulsion to sell produce only in apmc...We usually sell it in our farm...So what govt. Achieve by that provision,
12427,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Absolutely wonderful video and spot on, Ganesh! However, I have one quick addition/counterpoint to this. Making MSPs a norm for 20 odd crops is practically non-viable for the government since rice and wheat are predominantly the largest in the market. MSP acts as a back-up safety net mechanism if the rates fall well below threshold, and MSP was primarily introduced to reduce the exploitative nature of middlemen and also at a time when India faced acute food shortages. Policies in times of surplus food cannot be the same as back-up plans, which is why the govt. cannot bear the grunt of always ensuring MSP in a time where private players have become inevitable like you said. MSP is usually much higher than market rates tbh, and higher MSP also fuels high crop inflation, thereby hurts economic growth. That said, the trade-off in deciding/regulating the MSP by the govt. for each crop is a ridiculously hard but a necessary task to be done.",

12431,76w6GQ1vs1Y,1st time i understood about farm bill. Thank q,
12432,76w6GQ1vs1Y,If we say APMC has loophole then how that is passed in parliament and being followed now?,
12433,76w6GQ1vs1Y,There is loophole in any new system. if identified find a solution to close it and that&#39;s how every system is evolving. If we thing about only possibilities of loopholes then we end doing nothing and stay with old system for ever. This is will lead to another issue in coming years. So something is better than nothing and keep monitoring any loopholes and block it with amendment.,

12441,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Farmers do grow crops by taking loan from the buyers which is a common thing and their loan gets deducted when they sell their crops but this laws will end that system so they can&#39;t get loans . Most of the farmers have already took loan from bank so no more loan how will they get money to store crops,

You forgot to look at the history of companies like starbucks in India on how secured are their farmers? <br>You analysed good on theoretical aspects but missed basic ground realities terribly.",
12443,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Why did the bill restricted the farmers to seek justice in courts in case of their exploitation? Why is there no MSP gurantee if the prospects are so fruitful? Why the jurisdiction was limited upto an IAS officer? Doesnt that answers the very intent behind the law? Can you analyse what was next to happen with farmers?,

12469,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Wonderful unbiased report... Well Done <br><br>1) MSP if implemented with Appropriate Reviews Periodically then this Assurance will protect the Farmers hence he will not Hoard by unnecessarily store in Paid Warehouses again another cost  burden and Buyers cannot form cartel to exploit the farmers and eventually farmers also cannot exploit the buyers - Win-Win situation <br><br>2) Corporates have sophisticated Lawyer Services / Consultants Who Could Come up with not easily Comprehend able Legal Terms and Concepts to the farmers, Govt. Political party lobbies farmers cannot withstand on the other hand poor farmers have nothing in their hand to bargain and/or balance the unfair Advantages &amp; Leverages Corporates may eventually have in the form of Lifestyle/ Business &amp; Agriculture ecosystem changes which he explained with ola taxi concept <br><br>2) Then farmers may be forced to modify/ upgrade the quality of produce by pursuading to invest in technologies/ machinery equipments thereby to get loans with different incomprehensible interest rates and collateral concepts risking farmers society to severe stress and may cause everything to give up farming and their farm lands to corporates to step in acquiring the land held as collateral thereby opening a Pandora box luring other farmers to sell their land at an attractive price initially &amp; forcing the small and surrounded land owners to sell at very unfair exploitative price... This would turn a whole society of farmers into exile leaving their land (once fed them and the entire nation if not the wider world) behind them in the hands of Corporate Exploits and big Richer Business people.<br><br>After the honeymoon with the corporate cash from land sale These people may become unskilled and unemployed and poverty may force these unemployed people to realize they all of them one by one were systematically Cheated by the prevailing system in the society and may turn angry against the society and may lead to violence and civil unrest which certainly put a nation at risk of lawlessness and disrupt to the economy leads to no confidence among society leads to instability and capital fly off inflation and civil unrest to civil war.... With these eventualities Risk in mind policy makers and strategists and bureaucrats should give thorough and multiple dimension factors and analysis before giving to corporate lobbyists and media propaganda and hence would need to talk and assure the fearing farmers and explain to them in lay Man terms and then properly drawn out decision should be taken. People should be very very patient and should check their own emotions under control and hope for the dialogue with relevant stakeholders to get Win-Win situation for all and the nation.",

12490,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"If govt brings in MSP below which a Pvt company can&#39;t procure farm produce and on the other end if govt regulates the prices at which the companies can sell those produce to the consumers such that there would be ceiling prices above which the produce can&#39;t be sold, there&#39;d be a very little profit margin for the procuring companies. There would be very less scope for such companies to grow as their revenue/profit will remain more or less stagnant over the years. Even taking inflation and thereby according change in MSP and ceiling prices into consideration, the situation doesn&#39;t change much. In such a scenario, why any pvt company would want to participate, as their sole motivation is growing business and making profits, which is being curbed through such policy. A growing profit-making business not only benefits the company owners but also benefits society through increasing employment/wages and indirectly benefits the shareholders of the company as share prices go up. Considering the merits of the proposed amendments in the farm bills as discussed in the video as well as the probable demerits I mentioned above, govt may set up a few companies like IRCTC, IRFC, BSNL etc, which are not exactly profit-oriented as they monopolise (with the exception of BSNL currently) their respective markets to a certain extent. I said a few companies instead of a single company because it would generate limited competition rather than a monopoly in agro produce market as all the companies would have to comply with the govt regulated MSP and ceiling prices but they would have the freedom to set up their own prices within that range. Hence, the freedom to sell and buy depending upon the price/quality of products would also be transferred to the farmers and consumers respectively.",

Their taste is splendid too, especially the double spicey noodles that come in purple color packing. I consume Yippie noodles more than Maggi. <br><br>Let me give you an example. I was once eating maggi. My 2 year old son came to me and was sitting beside me watching TV while I was eating. He smelled the Maggi and asked me to give him a spoonful. When I gave him, he loved it. Later, I also gave him, Top Ramen, Tom Ramen curry, patanjali noodles, knorr noodles, yippie &amp; wai wai. He only loved yippie and Maggi. That&#39;s how my son started consuming noodles.

13056,k-51exmR9R4,"<b>History repeating like during WW2 and WW1/Spanish plague.  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic, and now under WW3 and a corona virus pandemic. Hitler used Zyklon B rodent extermination gas with the fumant removed.  It causes symptoms like corona virus.  Look up in the sky you will see planes spraying your cities!  Hitler attacked Russia, just like what is happening now.  The British Empire had no legal male Heir so they imported a fake one from Germany.  The British Queen&#39;s husband &quot;Prince Philip&quot; renounced his German citizenship, became a Greek citizen and as a Greek citizen moved to Britain gaining citizenship there.  After gaining citizenship, he was appointed a Duke, out of thin air and then as a Prince and married Queen Elizabeth.  &quot;Prince Philip&quot; took the name of the Queen, not the other way, as it usually is done, where a wife takes the husband&#39;s name.  The British Empire has run out of male Heirs at least twice, and they kill to suppress it.    WW2 was a way of hiding this fraud, and now WW3 is a way of hiding that illegal combines Heir. The Bible says that a male would not fail to sit on the throne.  A family name continues through the males, not the females, and Philip was a fraud.  He had become a Greek citizen to make it appear that he was a Royal from the earlier Greek dynasty.</b>  Total theater.  <b>The Catholic Empires of the Roman Empire form one leg and the UK(British controlled) Empire forms the other leg of the Roman Empire, with the King Pope Francis as the ruler of the whole system.  He has a triple teired crown with 666 on it in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  He is a King of the city state of the Vatican(the Vatican is the smallest Country in the world), Rome Italy, and is mentioned in Revelation, Apocalypse, 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions that this Empire is responsible for all those slaughtered on earth.  It mention what the leaders wear, which is scarlet(Cardinals), and Purple(Bishops).  The UK leg Royals also wear those colors, a long with Judges and Magistrates of the Crown.  They refer to this entity as the Crown.  When some one goes to court in one of the British subservient Nations, it is said that the Crown has a case against the person.</b>  Canada, Australian and others are not sovereign or free.  please read Revelation Apocalypse 17,18, and study it closely, because this Empire comes as a false system claiming to represent God, but exterminates to stay in power.  <b>1Timothy3:1-16 mentions that the one looking after a group(Church) should be a husband of one wife with obedient children.  The Pope and the Priests of the Catholic Church are forbidden to marry, and so don&#39;t even qualify, according to the very book and God they say they claim to represent(an unmarried man has no wife or children.)   The Bible&#39;s Peter&#39;s mother in-law was cured by Jesus(Yeshua).  So if Peter had a mother in law, then he had a wife as there is no other way.</b>  That is why Catholic Priest have sex with so many little boys, girls and women attendees.  <b>There was over ninety cases of Preists molesting little boys in the city of Boston, USA alone.  None of the Priests were disciplined, but were only moved to a different location, and now you know why.  The whole system is a fraud.</b>  So this organization has many false teachings.  <b>The Roman Emporer forced a combining of Biblical and Pagan beliefs, when Rome Nationalized the Church.  Rome forbid the celebration of Biblical Holy days and Sabbaths under threat of beatings, then confiscation of property and finally death.   Many beheaded or burned alive.</b>  Revelation Apocalypse 18:4 says get out of this organization &quot;my people&quot; if you don&#39;t want to receive her plagues.  <b>Freedom to communicate is under attack by Church and State, up to the point they are threatening to bomb the microprocessor production facilities.</b>  Pray for me and you, please!  <b>Russia says they have the proof that Britain was involved in at least thres major terror attacks against Russia.</b>  Would Russia bomb their own 5+ Billion pipeline, their own bridge, powerplants and Navel yards?  <b>NATO said that they would attack the Solomon Islands if they militarize their island, because Australia would feel threatened, but NATO was militarizing Ukraine, where they had bunkers full of weapons.  NATO&#39;s puppet regime in Ukraine was banning the Russian language and culture even though that was many people&#39;s only language.  The Ukrainian Capital is a Russian word until Western media changed it to hide the Russian history, as Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a recent NATO coup, which the US planned, as they told their dignitaries not to attend the Russian Olympics at that time. You could go to prison for teaching the Russian language. All opposition parties in Ukraine (banned).  Those with out blue arm bands(now yellow?) being put to death.</b>  Many US Officials had been talking about a coming war with Russia and China.  Years in advance.  <b>Donald J Trump said he couldn&#39;t answer corona virus questions claiming we are at war.</b>  Trump said that the US will soon be at war with Russia and China. <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, but are part of China, as acknowledged by most nations of the world till recently.</b>  NATO is planning to do to Taiwan and China what they did to Ukraine and Russia.  <b>Britain fighting for Democracy in Ukraine?  Britain has had two or three Prime Ministers that have not been ellected, trying to help the naked Emporer.</b>  Think!  <b>Nancy Pelosi&#39;s husband&#39;s attack is a fraud.  The Police changed and contradicted the events multiple times and it makes no sense.</b>  Corona virus is a code name for information that exposes the crown(Government/Royals).  A vaccine is computer/electronic device program that deletes information from your view(anti virus software).  Symptoms for a biological virus comes from being gased, radiated or sprayed in your environment.  <b>Planes fly in parallel patterns, causing heating of your environment and breathing difficulties.  Like Hitler killed by Zyklon B gas, so now they use a deadly gas in incubators.</b>  Donald J Trump said he would put Hilary R Clinton in prison when ellected for starting a war and genocide in Libya, but when he got in power did nothing.  Americans have started many unjust wars.  <b>America/NATO is about to start wars with Ethiopia, Haiti, Taiwan, Korea, Syria, Iran, Russia and the list goes on.  NATO Countries have invaded more than half of all sovereign Nations on earth, in the last 30 years.</b>  When you print money on paper and then go buy things with it, and it is not backed by any thing then you have to attack a lot of people to keep the scheme going.  <b>New Central Bank digital currencies(CBDCs) will be centralized and backed only by cow farts and trust, where as Bitcoin is decentralized and backed by gold.  Bitcoin/gold and silver came under a major attack by the crown(governments).  The digital currencies will create a M.O.B. type system, that if you get in government cross hairs you will be shut out of the system just like Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Russia and so on and so on.  If they do it to a complete Country, then they will have no problem doing it to individuals.  Canada confiscated people&#39;s money breaking international law.</b>  Rome enters a Country, exterminates, and keeps the remaining people&#39;s in refugee camps called Reserves.  Periodically they thin out the population.  They usually make a lot of noise about sport team names with Native names and how people are trying to erase their names, so as to hide the real erasure of actual peoples.  <b>Revelation 7:9, God says he would take out of all Nations and Tribes and Peoples a people for himself.  God accepts all those who accept him of all Nationalities.</b>  Donald J Trump started operation warp speed to force vaccinate the American people by military nurses.  Trump added death by electrocution, firing squad, poison gas to the already used lethal injection.   <b>Trump foretold war on Russia and China years in advance, a said no one would protect the Pope more than him.</b>  America turned it&#39;s back on God, so now he is turning his back on you.  <b>The US, Canada, Germany, Italy, Britain, Australia, Austria, Ukraine and many other Nations refused to agree and voted against a move at the United Nations to condemn Nazism.  Russia voted against Nazism.  Remember the Nazis?  They started WW2 and exterminated 12000000 human beings, often by extremely cruel means.  The Ukraine military has a entire Nazi battalion the Azov Nazi battalion.  Church leaders clearly seen in Hitler&#39;s Nazi SS footage blessing the troops before slaughters.  The Azov Steel Works was full of Nazis that surrendered to Russia, with pictures confirming their Nazi swastikas tattooed on their bodies.</b>  Ukraine banned all opposition parties and is trying to exterminate the Russian language, people and culture.  Teachers are sent to prison for teaching the Russian language in areas where most only speak Russian.  <b>Fighting for Democracy?</b>  Britain installed two Prime Ministers that were not elected.  <b>Donald J Trump used his office while President to start a business so called &quot;Truth Social&quot; that he claimed would enable free speech.  Later Mr.Trump tried to get the Justice department to stop late night hosts from talking about him.  So supposedly creating free speech over here, but attacking free speech over there.</b>  Russia and China no longer accept US fiat currency, so G7 banned Russian gold. Supposed unbiased media not allowing comments, is a mass deception and contrary to their purpose. CBDCs attacking crypto. 1933 the US confiscated gold.   For 50 years, 10 years in prison for having it, and only ended when gold was separated from backing money in 1971 now backed by cow farts. 2022 Biden bans Russian gold.  Military wearing US/UK flags in Ukraine. UK/Rome&#39;s &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;¬≤ UK suppression",

Unusual take since his home country, India, is aligning itself solidly with the Western powers more and more with each passing year. India itself is far more concerned with China&#39;s future hegemony than it is with Western  hegemony. But when listening to this biased propaganda, one would think it&#39;s not so. Also, I find it laughable that some comments seem to think he&#39;s so &quot;unbiased&quot; because he&#39;s from India! ü§£ So he&#39;s automatically the smartest, and least biased one in the room because of his race!?

13369,IBbz8sjVz6I,"It is more complicated. Russia is being hurt also, but Putin has an advantage in having an authoritarian government. The real conflict will not be so much within the EU, but between the EU and the US. US gas companies are now selling gas to the EU at 3 - 10 times the price that EU was paying Russia. But for the US the problem is domestic politics. We have been at war now for over 20 years. And the people at the bottom have been taking a beating. The US has inequality that is comparable to a third-world country. The US economy is being hurt very little compared to the EU and third world because of sanctions. But that little could be enough to generate political chaos. Americans do not really care about foreign policy when the domestic economy is poor. So we could have the EU turning against the US, while the American people turn against the Biden administration. People around the world are seeing how dangerous the US is. They are taking steps to protect themselves from unilateral US sanctions. The US must give up some power. But so far there is no indication that it will do so peacefully. If the US goes into recession, the rest of the world should be frightened. Remember how Hitler pulled Germany out of the depression. The US is a wartime economy. We know only one way to solve problems. Bomb, invade, sanction.",

Russians will quit supporting this war once it starts hitting Russian citizens. Matter of time. Simple that they can&#39;t sustain their cruise missile usage and etc with the sanctions In place.

13422,31UVvKEYO6k,I had OnePlus One in 2014. OnePlus one could not be purchased directly. You need a reference link to buy the phone which can be only sent buy person who have purchased the phone and that too only 1 link. Oneplus One craze in tech community was so high in 2014 that people use to sell reference link for $100 in Craigslist. Proud owner of Oneplus One‚Ä¶ I still have that phone with me.,
13423,31UVvKEYO6k,So basically both one plus and boat used celebrities to push their product along with a low price point,
13424,31UVvKEYO6k,"More than the fancy marketing, what worked for boat was quality of its products.",
13425,31UVvKEYO6k,"Boat on quality front is ok,but the perceived value of the brand is higher due to endorsement by a Cricketer &amp; Bollywood artiste.Lastly some spill over benefit of Shark Tank episode to the brand.",
13426,31UVvKEYO6k,It‚Äôs naive to say that humans can‚Äôt discern the quality of the earphone . They absolutely can. You can üíØ % tell the difference between a cheap headset and a Bose or a Sony. The noise cancellation isn‚Äôt the same on the cheaper ones.,

13433,31UVvKEYO6k,Congratulations to them for reaching this position! It‚Äôs truly crazy!! But‚Ä¶.<br>I have faced quite a lot quality issues after a short period of buying their products‚Ä¶.hence I‚Äôve decided to buy from any other company but boAt.<br>And I have about 5-6 friends with the same opinion.<br><br>They should really work on the longitivtiy of their products.,
13434,31UVvKEYO6k,I&#39;m watching this video with boat headphones on.....,
13435,31UVvKEYO6k,"Boat is just a overrated over marketed, white labelling company, this is happening because of chutiyas like us.",
13436,31UVvKEYO6k,youtube creator make people comnect to them while famous celeb lifestyles we crave for them,
13437,31UVvKEYO6k,"I think that the real reason for boat&#39;s success was aggressive pricing and good customer support during warranty period, rather than celebrity endorsements, that is secondary.",
13438,31UVvKEYO6k,People bought one plus 7 because what an amazing specs they provided in 5 and 6 at mid market range .. and after 8 series the downfall of one plus started<br>Edit: I still use one plus 6 along with iPhone pro max,
13439,31UVvKEYO6k,Boat lives off on amazon seller discount (amazon charges boat 5% instead of 15%).<br>Wait for IPO and cease of amazon seller discount,
13440,31UVvKEYO6k,"Not just Aspirational value, But Product quality and customer service also matters. <br>Few years ago Micromax endorsed with Hugh jackman, Lava with Farhan akhtar but it failed miserably due to lack of Quality in smartphones.",
13441,31UVvKEYO6k,Empty vessels make too much of noise and time will tell the perpetuity of such organizations which tries to play with the psychological aspects of customers. Indian entrepreneurs should learn from Japanese and Koreans that the quality is here to stay rest are the noise which will fade out,

13445,31UVvKEYO6k,First you&#39;ve missed Sony in this picture. Second boat audio is not that good to amaze a audiophile or a good heavy user.<br>.<br> I&#39;m heavy user of overhead phones.Due to work I use Bose qc35ii for almost 10hrs a day. My cousin hyped me for his boat wireless and i tried. I couldn&#39;t bear it  even for 10 mins. Going premium for them is very difficult beacause they&#39;ll need research and development facility.  Also compete with sony Bose and apple. <br>.<br>Third they are going in smart watch market which is totally different to making earphones. So i doubt the brand.,

13469,31UVvKEYO6k,"Yes, the choice of ambassadors did make a difference. Mivi&#39;s earphones have metallic polish. It&#39;s shiny. Things that are shiny, things that are fluorescent are preferred by reactive people, who don&#39;t have any authoritative figures. They are all about entertainment. And that&#39;s why mivi chose CarryMinati. Carry is a reactive, hyperactive person on screen who makes people laugh at his reactivity or hyperactive behavior. On the other hand, boat has positioned itself as something sturdy and strong, and you can see that its exterior looks rugged. Any person who would like something strong is a person who follows strong authoritative figures and is passionate at heart. That&#39;s why they chose Hardik Pandya. It&#39;s all about the positioning and presentation of the USP of the product.",

13479,31UVvKEYO6k,Hi bro make a video of realme phone company,
13480,31UVvKEYO6k,For me the main reason for buying a boat earphones is its hastle free and no questions asked replacement. That too at the cost of a wireless chinese earphone which costed me 300-350; with Boat i could buy wireless for 600 which is not much of a difference,
13481,31UVvKEYO6k,BoAt products are Made in China,

13490,31UVvKEYO6k,The consumer base of both groups carryminati and the rishab pant makes the difference. That&#39;s from my side,
13491,31UVvKEYO6k,"I think it&#39;s an oversimplification to attribute one plus&#39; success to the campaign featuring Robert downey jr. As far as I&#39;ve observed over the years, one plus became popular because they delivered stupendous value for money and a clean UI with customisations available. Their phones used to sell like hot cakes even before the aforesaid ad campaign, the ad campaign may have helped in boosting sales but it wasn&#39;t as significant as you&#39;ve made it out to be.",
13492,31UVvKEYO6k,One video on sula vineyards,

13495,31UVvKEYO6k,I think that the main reason for their success is that they bought up a brand value using celebraties + budget friendly product in market...when compared to other products they were missing any one of these.Hence they had a good market uplift,

Thanks for bringing to light this meticulously planned operation by a well run corporate giant ITC.",
13589,DzZCVqrtXYw,Implement Farmers law,
13590,DzZCVqrtXYw,This is the reason why farm bill was passed by Modi govt. But the cartel of  traders agitation destroyed the farmers. The Govt is now trying some other method to help farmers indirectly with yours help directly.,

13592,DzZCVqrtXYw,Would be great to hear u if u go slow with ur spoken english.. do not rush,
13593,DzZCVqrtXYw,"We can&#39;t generalise the &quot;pathetic state of farmers&quot; statement just like that ... agri products attract the least tax and receive the most subsidy . Probably the problem is in the way smaller farmers farms . They have not kept up with modern agri techniques ... because there are clans of farmers who are making crores from farming and then there are the other small farmers who gasp for air . In India if there is a skewed distribution of wealth , skills and power in any sector that has to be agri sector. Not to mention the brokers who bleed small farmers to death .... just a few months back the rich farmer clans so eloquently kept the whole system alive .",
13594,DzZCVqrtXYw,Tamil Nadu introduced Uzhavar Santhai. Can you make a video on that. That will improve the profitability of farmers drastically,
13595,DzZCVqrtXYw,Finally someone pointed out what&#39;s wrong with our Indian agriculture industry. Where are those people who were against the farm bills put out by the government. Because of dumb wits went against that bill our farmers might never get their rights.,
13596,DzZCVqrtXYw,Literally this video made me cry how farmers were been looted for not giving enough share of profit to even survive<br><br>Thanku ITC,
13597,DzZCVqrtXYw,so were they buying directly from farmers?<br>and if through apmc then what difference did it make?,
13598,DzZCVqrtXYw,By sue farmers for growing potatoes.,

13601,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,"I think the benefits for the common person is highly outweighed by the losses. I mean paying for messaging apps, losing our privacy to government officials and this bill stifling innovation are way greater threats to our personal freedoms than receiving a few spam calls a day. The biggest point is, this gives the government way too much control than they should have in a democratic country. They are elected and supposed to work for the people...this bill total subverts that. If national security is their only argument to stand on (when there already exists other IT acts that take care of this problem), then the formation of this bill is truly suspicious (not all of it but major parts of it at least).",

13608,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,India is going to be just like China in terms of digital privacy (0),
13609,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,"Good coverage. It would also help if you talk about how banks and Telecom companies in India are colluding to create false identities, creating demat accounts with these identities , taking control of your online (and consequently your offline life) presence, siphoning off govt funds right under the nose of GoI with these identities...in reality you are only the face of virtual identity they&#39;ve created. It&#39;s the mafia that is controlling Indians and all of this is made possible through apps that ask for access to your mic, wifi, bluetooth, images, and every damn folder on your phone. Every new app out there is &quot;innovating &quot; for the mafia and not for the people. And they keep the momentum of the so-called libertarian narratives that the GoI is killing innovation blah blah blah.  Truth is GoI is finally taking steps to rein in and control apps that are aiding the mafia building a parallel economy and completely derailing real economy for Indians. This is reality and if you take a closer look at outsourcing in banks, app updates on Google Play... you&#39;ll understand that you are working day in and day out for filling the mafia coffers and GoI is trying to protect you from these economy looters. &quot;Freedom and innovation&quot; are buzzwords that aid a thriving mafia that makes you work for it and uses you as a tool against the elected government. You are either the mafia&#39;s tool or it&#39;s enemy. Make your choice. Read the draft bill and share your day-to-day experiences as a citizen of this country, at every public service touch point pertaining to telecom service providers viz., banks, hospitals, postal services, retail, e-commerce and app delivery platforms. We or the GoI are not in control of these channels anymore because of laws that aren&#39;t updated to manage this new world. Read, think and share your viewpoints. Put your critical thinking hat on and stop slaving over esoteric ideas about &quot;innovation&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; They are just constructs of a mind that is trained to &quot;fight&quot;law makers. It&#39;s merely a distraction. Get to reality - Fight the mafia and take control of your economy and your life. Make the law your partner and make it as stringent as possible for the mafia - that&#39;s exactly what the GoI is trying to do. If you are not a mafia tool,  there is nothing to be afraid of. Build and protect this nation for your future generations. Jai Hind.",
13610,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,Is video commenrts me log bol rahe hai ki positive criticism hai. Is video me agar Government ki jagah Modi Government bol deta to in sabki g***d jal jati.,
13611,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,The bill doesn&#39;t seem to be all bad as is being projected in a few media platforms. Licensing apps is unnecessary and undesirable but unbridled roll out of apps can also be a problem - instead of licensing apps there should be a mechanism to ban harmful apps and there should be checks and balances to ensure that this power to ban is not absolute. Similarly with internet shutdown - the power should not be absolute.,
13612,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,&quot;National Security&quot; actually means the Security of BJP government. This man is destroying our country.,
13613,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,"Rubbish comments, childish",
13614,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,This guy has half understanding of the draft bill.,

13617,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,This is Chinese sponsored‚Ä¶,
13618,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,&quot;A matter of National Security&quot;. The age-old cry of the oppressor.,
13619,ycLO5Oa5ZI8,"This is the first video where I majorly disagree on most of your points:<br>1. Carrier v/s. Content: This is a long-standing issue in US too... Netflix / YouTube vs Comcast. It is not about &quot;leveling field&quot; as you say. It is because network providers like comcast are not ready to get bogged down just because YouTube / Netflix offered 4K services. Obviously Carrier is spending more to shuttle all that extra traffic and paying for hardware / bandwidth and they will have to raise their network prices. What is the advantage for the carrier? It has only been resolved by higher internet prices for home and excessively so for mobile. Just study US market with the highest carrier prices (home / mobile).<br>2. Data-Privacy / Lawful Interception: I agree. Btw, the way there is no need for a platform to enable 2-way encryption. If you really need to encrypt your communication (for whatever purposes, corporate, personal, govt. etc.) there are always means to do that (sender and receiver can both agree on 100&#39;s of mechanisms out there). Platform doesn&#39;t necessarily need to provide that service. It is a bonus for people who do not know. My apologies for the crude example... It is same as knowing how like a Mafia know how to dispose off a dead body vs just dumping it in a secluded place in a suitcase not knowing if any witnesses saw it or CCTVs caught it.<br>3. User / Caller Identity: You are misconstruing facts here. There is a difference between &quot;Privacy&quot; and &quot;Anonymity&quot;. Same debate can be had for &quot;Ensuring a Single Person in an ATM booth with hidden keypad&quot; v/s &quot;Wearing a Helmet in an ATM booth&quot;. <br>4. KYC:  Know-Your-Customer/Consumer is necessary... Not-having-KYC is absolutely not in conflict or serve any benefit for the consumer in any form or manner.<br>5. Insolvency Code: Why Govt. shouldn&#39;t get back control of the Spectrum in case of insolvency. Banks own the financial / funding of operations aspect; they don&#39;t own the spectrum / technology. It is like if you are bankrupt, the bank which loaned your house will now own your wife / spouse. There is no transitive ownage concept like in the feudal system of yore. What can be given, can be revoked. It is that simple. Consumer-will changes and Govt-security is the only debatable point here. A very loose one at that as in that too consumer in a free market is free to choose.<br>6. Internet Lockdown: Why this is even a problem. Internet is not a &quot;Fundamental Right&quot;. Every country has an &quot;Emergency / Crisis / National Security&quot; provision. In case of &quot;Financial Distress&quot; SEBI / Market has the right to choose, why shouldn&#39;t Govt. In case of a war or such conditions &quot;Civil rights are dissolved&quot;. Lawful blockage of internet or a wire-tap (a non-fundamental right) is also had via Legal means. It is not in Govt. / Police hands. What is even the point here?<br><br>Of course, there are problems of over-reach / opposition suppression, those are the &quot;real&quot; points to be addressed here...",

China simply sends troops across Tibet and directly attack New Delhi like in 1960s. Any maritime force is totally unnecessary. India&#39;s Geography makes it a country very vulnerable to attacks. Its most populous area - the northern part - is largely plain: ez to attack and hard to defend. Any war in the northern part would deal great damage to India&#39;s agriculture and industries. India should not play fire with China. It takes decades to build a city such as New Delhi, but it only takes a few days to destroy it.",

13908,VPFGqmFTKSM,"Here is a basic problem I see with  Indian startups in general,  almost all the startups (the so-called unicorns) are rarely (if ever) based on some new technology. Sure companies like nykaa and byju&#39;s may have a good business model. But the problem with a good business model is that you cannot make it proprietary. Anyone can copy it. <br>I think the focus should be more on novel technology/ processes that a startup has to offer and not just on valuation and business models.",

13915,VPFGqmFTKSM,Then how udemy is so successful?? It&#39;s because they are able to give it on low cost. Choice of options are diverse.

The problem with PW is that they are not matching the demand to supply. They are providing too much when there&#39;s no demand for them. I think in the long run only unacademy will survive as they know the business the best. They don&#39;t have followers, they have students. You give them money and they teach you, simple. But in case of apni kaksha and PW there&#39;s a lot more and people are expecting too much from them. And since they&#39;re so cheap too many non serious students are buying them which will prevent serious students from buying them. They won&#39;t be able to produce results in the long run. And PW as a company is getting into too much controversies. Last few months there have been more controversies than teaching in PW which is not at all good for companies reputation. I decided to buy competishun insted of PW just because I didn&#39;t wanted to take part in any of their lafdas.

14085,1qEZwj_Iacw,"There are two aspects to healthcare: availability of good doctors and hospitals is one, accessibility and affordability is the other. India needs to work on both. And by providing the financial backing to those who need it most, India has taken a very important step in the right direction. This issue is much better taken care of in countries like Germany. However, despite top quality doctors and hospitals most Americans find it difficult to get health care, leave alone good health care because millions have no insurance and all those who live outside of major metropolitan cities have poor quality doctors and hospitals. Waiting time is often months and emergency services are staffed poorly. American spending on healthcare is almost twice as high as Germany‚Äôs but the health outcome is worse than in Germany!",

14166,qL4DvHZUPfc,Paytm Vijay is a corporate criminal. In 2021 he issued IPO shares for 2100 Rs and it fell well under 600 Rs. Now he is buying back those shares at the price of 850. Those who have invested 2100 per share were fooled by Vijay. I expect this company to shut it&#39;s business soon,

14199,qL4DvHZUPfc,@think school - This approach of unnecessarily giving 100s of examples to explain the case study is really very boring and monotonous. You often deviate from the Topic by sharing these Silly EXAMPLES and spend 90% of the time on examples rather than explaining the case. This not only makes your Video lengthy but Boring as well. An ideal case  study has 3 Aspects - 1.) Background of the problem 2.) Problem Statement  3.) Solution  4.) the Impact of the Case on the viewers/audience. Your case studies miss most of the key ingredients and Focus on those Silly examples of - &quot;if Ram buys 100 shares of Rs. 10 each it will bring Rs. 1000&quot;...These examples are really stupid as every layman understands these things. You waste your&#39;s and our time by quoting More examples than Required.,

14209,nPrVYCtJfgQ,You are too diplomatic to speak truth. Looks like you chose money over morality. At least have guts to quote twitter‚Äôs founder that Twitter employees are leftist. Censorship was mostly targeted towards right wing.,
14210,nPrVYCtJfgQ,Hate speech is great. It might teach people how to not listen to idiots while they remain vocal instead of silencing them. You can not filter bad from good if you never encounter bad.,
14211,nPrVYCtJfgQ,So the solution is: Elon should buy our education system to turn millions of dumb monkeys into humans capable of operating their free speech.,
14212,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"bro.. your research needs to include listening to the &#39;other side&#39;, including those people that MSM says are &#39;far right&#39;, &#39;extremists&#39;, &#39;hateful bigots&#39;, etc. because then you realise those are actually smears on mostly moderate-thinking/centrist people trying to speak out on shenanigans. it&#39;s all part of US domestic politics/power struggles, and you&#39;re getting swept/up fooled by one side&#39;s propaganda.",

Shouldn&#39;t we filter that also based on lot of parameters? But we can&#39;t right.,
14219,nPrVYCtJfgQ,I disagree with the fact that only some people should free speech because if only selected people have it that would turn out be dictatorship but with extra steps.,

14221,nPrVYCtJfgQ,Dude I have the exact same T shirt from Wrogn!!<br><br>I feel Elon Musk is too overrated by the US. In our country we consider billionaires are forerunners in developing the nation.

The same is the case with Twitter‚Äôs takeover. Who asked you to worry about free speech.<br>I think we as investors must question his decisions. He is a billionaire because of invested wealth and not accumulated wealth nor assets,
14222,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"I say buying Twitter  by Elon musk  has it&#39;s own Republican politics,  after his buying Twitter  he reopened Donalad trump&#39;s account...soon Twitter will be closed or temporarily closed before USA election  ,this will happen  I bet",

14231,nPrVYCtJfgQ,good to know you are not  a bhakt,
14232,nPrVYCtJfgQ,You got wrong definition of free speech bro,
14233,nPrVYCtJfgQ,It is undoubtedly an attempt to close Twitter,
14234,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"Thinkschool is usually pretty good but they are absolutely completely wrong on this one.<br>1. yes, the description of echo chambers and how they can cause riots is accurate. But the fact that algorithms are designed to promote this for business interest is absolutely wrong., The algortihms are designed this way to profit USA causing instability in countries they like to topple to loot resources. Like by doing Arab spring or right now causing unrest in iran etc. before social media, they used to use NGO&#39;s for this purpose, Read the case of Libya for that. <br><br>2. The definition of free speech is wrong. free speech is inhibition of speech by government. it does not apply to private corporations making their own community guidelines to curtail speech. Elon is talking about US and EU government interference in social media platforms being removed and not making the platform free for all. Which is why USA and EU have totally lost their minds and are threatening to ban twitter altogether.<br><br>3. Read manufacturing consent by Naom Chomsky to understand what this entire thing is., Briefly - defence contractors and wall street pays donations to politicians in USA. Politicians start wars to make money for defence contractors. The resulting economic disruption means that fed can raise rates and dollar becomes stronger and in the swinging market, wall street makes money. At the same time energy companies and other giant companies get benefit as USa and Eu loot resources from these war torn countries. the same fed rate hikes that strenghten dollar, weaken other currencies and cause recession all over the world. But because west has a stronger labour market it didnt affect them till now. Since 2008, developing countries have turned the tables but that is a separate story.<br><br>Now the politicians create these wars through social media. But how? Look, the same corporations that profit from wars and give donations to politicians also control western media - through advertising. western media then structures itself to only hire people that spread propaganda that supports and justifies USA wars and bashes any country that disagrees even a little bit. You dont have to curtail speech when you can control the thoughts of people. because what they need is support from their own people to spread the narrative that their brutal wars are &quot;justified&quot;.<br><br>But social media is different. On this every person can speak. So here the western governments have their own bots to spread narratives and departments that remove any content that disagrees with them, Just recently there was a report that Department of Homeland security in USA was purging posts that countered western narrative of Ukraine war. And they use advertisers to pressure social media to maintain algorithms that favor this narrative as well.<br><br>Some platforms are able to maintain echo bubbles of two different groups on the same plaform who rarely converse with each other. Google has been able to maintain that., But in USA most platforms have gone further than that. Just like media in west has divided itself into left and rigth, dem and repub, so has social media. Which means that advertisers.corporations supporting dems buy ads on certain social media platforms which makes that platform dem leaning and vice versa with repubs. Facebook has become more and more repub leaning and twitter had become more and more left leaning.<br><br>But now  the platforms are no longer restricted to USA. They have spread out into the world. and the narrative in these countries will be totally different from USA. Now USA has been trying to use these platforms to spread their own narrative and suppressing everyone else. This has caused these platforms to not be very popular elsewhere and reports of these riots caused through these platforms have given them a serious reputational blow. At the same time, these other countries have started their own platforms which support their narrative and are gaining popularity world wide and coming back and causing dents in western narrative when their own citizens use it. That is why all this banning nonsense starts.<br><br>So this causes a fundamental problem. Now businesses only care about making more and more money. So they have noticed two things.<br>1. because of political influences domestically, they have to ban all the users who dont politically agree with the echo chamber they support. Like twitter banned most trump supporters.<br>2. Because of inernational geopolitics they get banned from other countries.<br>In both cases they are losing users and at the same time are facing more competition as new platforms pop up. Eg trump starting truth social. In the meantime, the social divide keeps growing. But so does the gvt control on the platform. So even the users on it cant speak their minds due to  fear of censorship and they lose interest and engagement declines and they move to new platforms who are at the beginning of this cycle. That is what is happening with facebook. And as the engagement declines, advertisers pull out and revenue drops and these companies fail. We are seeing the start of that for many social media companies.<br><br>So to stay ahead of this game, they are looking for ways to change all of this. And it basically comes down to something that sounds like an oxymoron but isnt. To get more advertising revenue through higher engagement, these companies have to come out from under the control of advertisers. They need to flip the balance. Instead of advertisers/corporations-politician nexus aka deep state controlling the platform, the platform needs to control advetisers. But that means massive disruption, advertisers pulling our, social media company finding a way to remain profitable regardless, expanding to new countries and more people joining and advertisers coming back on the social media company&#39;s terms. <br><br>And this is good for countries like India because then our side of the story gets told and counters western propaganda.  But for that, these bubbles need to burst, people from different political ideologies and countries need to be put on the platform and algorithm needs to be designed to promote interaction between them. Echo chambers drive one kind of engagement. But bursting of these echo bubbles cause another kind of engagement which is good for growth of the platform and good for society as well. And That is what Elon is trying to do - remove the deep state censorship from social media. he is not sitting there trying to resolve the free speech debate. <br><br>As for that debate, I completely disagree with you there. You suggest that botched censorship of social media should beexcused because algorithm cannot decide morality of free speech. My argument is that that is why it shouldnt decide anything. We already have laws regarding what kind of speech is allowed. When you are walking on the street, you are pretty much allowed to say a lot of things except threaten someone, slander someone, or say incendiary things etc. So if social media companies want to operate in a country, they have to follow that countries regulations of free speech. As for international content, maximum possible allowance of free speech needs to be achieved between countries. It may not be perfect but making this sytem 1000 times better than what it is right now is really not that hard.<br><br>PS since he sold a bunch of his shares to raise the capital for the purchase, I have a sneaking suspicion that he purposefully id driving the stocks down so he can buy them back at a lower price before he actually makes the platform successful and their value rises again.",
14235,nPrVYCtJfgQ,You perfectly mentioned that censorship is necessary and i kinda agree to it. Can you really say that Twitter was applying censorship equally for different political and religious groups??,
14236,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"Well Itotally agree with the argument of echo chambers. But why the platform operators are trying suppress on particular ideology??!!<br>Also, the report says Twitter is the platform of &quot;hate speech&quot; and it has shot up 4 times; please ask the publisher to define hate speech!",

14239,nPrVYCtJfgQ,Well man listen you&#39;re just scratching the tip of the iceberg. Please listen to the Joe Rogan episode with the former twitter management. They have accepted to be suppressing any right wing or conservative views. Involvement of cambridge analytica to target ads during 2019 elections hired by congress against bjp.

14255,nPrVYCtJfgQ,"One mistake he did - not verifying the accounts that go for a blue tick. That&#39;s all I see. Also with free speech, as a human being, if you are not breaking a law, you have the right to say what you want. The internet is just a manifestation of what we are allowed to say in public as a human being. If your voice is more supressed online than face-to-face that makes no sense unless you are being opressed of your rights. Social media is a huge thing, it should not be used to supress political and even controversial views.....today&#39;s controversy may become the truth tomorrow. Just like with the virus.",

THEN they got the pandemic, war, commodity/energy crises, impending recession etc and were wholly unprepared for them. Is CS too big to fail? Probably. Its AUM is bigger than Swiss annual GDP. But the more important point is one that came out of the LEH bankruptcy, part of the systemic risk is how big the bank is, the other is how interconnected it is to other institutions, ie how many fuses lead to other powderkegs.",

14462,cXFn7FBgktA,"Sorry it‚Äôs me again, the world economy is based on banking.

Just like during Covid the wealth of the rich went up.<br>The problem is the banking system is designed for people to make money from figures on balance sheet and not actual money or collateral. It‚Äôs designed to use the people at the bottom ladder for the people at top to become richer whilst the people they are using are becoming poorer.<br>Until this system of fictional money is replaced by something real, this problem will not go away.<br>This system makes business, banks and other institutions because banks are creating money from thin air, money that doesn‚Äôt actually exist, and getting that money insured.<br>The whole system is not only flawed but waited towards the rich and finally it‚Äôs totally unfair and dysfunctional.",

14466,cXFn7FBgktA,"OBJECTIVE REALITY IS REAL.<br>A secret society covertly controls the world and they have being doing so for hundreds of years.  Those who belong to that secret society wish to take away our ability to interpret reality objectively.    They  wish us to falsely believe that objective reality does not even exist.   They wish to destroy our ability to think logically because they are attempting to take over the world and enslave us. <br>They have created at least twenty or thirty major hoaxes over the past many hundreds of years.  The following are a list of some but not all of their hoaxes:-   climate change, the spinning ball earth,  space exploration, religious apparations,  near death experiences, demonic possession, poltergeist activity. <br>Before they had brain weapon technology at their disposal they  possibly used magic lanterns and actors to pull off their hoaxes.   Now that brain weapon technology is in widepread use they are able to download  approximately  two thousand different experiences into any human brain which contains what is known as neural lace and they can also download experiences into any part of any human body which contains an intra-body nano-network.  <br>Those of us who are being subjected to wirelessly enabled Remote Neural Monitoring combined with Remote Neural Manipulation  over many years have experiences most if not all aspects of their brain weapon capabilities.   The unwilling subject of Remote Neural Monitoring combined with Remote Neural Manipulation is wirelessly connected  from self-replicating and self-assembling nano technology inside their brain and body to a computerized control system where data is both uploaded and downloaded to and from their brain and body.<br>That unwilling subject is made to hear sounds and voices, to see both still and moving images both in their minds and in locations around them, to feel pain, electric shock and other sensations throughout their bodies, including sexual abuse and they can also be subjected to fabricated smells and tastes.   They can also have their muscles both immobilized and moved against their wills.    Holograms can be made to appear close to them and sounds can be made to appear to come from both inside their heads and from other locations close to them.   They can be locked inside virtual reality holds where sounds, visions, sensations and feelings can all be downloaded into their brains as the same time, making them believe that they are in a heaven or a hell without them being able to realise that they are simply locked inside a virtual reality hold.  Frequency weapons are being used on a selection of individuals which force them to feel emotions which are not naturally being generated by their own brains.   Frequencies of terror were transmitted to me on a continual basis for a period of more than one year.  I was frozen in  fear for that entire year.  Furthermore, another known subject of brain research was locked into the frequency of aggression for a number of months which was so severe that he felt he could not visit his relative during that time due to his extreme feelings of aggression.     Because of these mostly unknown brain and body weapons capabilities,  unknown secret agents have been using them to attempt to make us misinterpret reality.    They have used their brain weapons to create and enhance many and varied hoaxes which have lead to worldwide misunderstandings on a wide scale. <br>In my opinion, the unknown secret agents have also manufactured  mechancial robots of all shapes and sizes which contain nano technology both inside and outside their bodies.   These mechanical robots can be externally wirelessly controlled to walk and talk.  .   They have been presented to members of the public as extra-terresterials and supernatural entities and  as many other creatures. <br>Due to advances in bio-technology, many of us can now be programmed by means of artificial intelligence to arrive at a pre-ordained destination at a precise time.    I was programmed to arrive at my home at precisely 11.11am each morning after being outside taking exercise in spite of that fact that  I did not wear a watch and I took different routes every morning.    Another individual who is unwillingly being subjected to brain research and who has authored many books about brain weapons, known as  Mark M Rich has claimed that a large number of people can be programmed to all arrive at the door of a store at precisely the same time so that some of them may wrongly assume that they are being stalked by the others. <br> Now, that we no longer believe in the many and varied hoaxes which they created for us we are able to interpret reality accurately again and we know without any doubt that objective reality exists now and always has done so.",

14503,r7JPdtYx4sg,"I think rather than Google, real knowledge of WPI and CPI are important for anyone attempting to make such videos. Sad to see so many views on content that has no real semblance to what RBI and Finance Ministry are actually doing, despite oil price instability.",
14504,r7JPdtYx4sg,"Dear Think School Team,<br>I am big fan and watches every videos of your and you guys really bring dynamic viewpoint. I really love your videos. But in this video CPI Formula used by you is wrong at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7JPdtYx4sg&amp;t=3m33s"">3:33</a> time frame.<br>CPI= [(Price in Current Year-Price in Comparative Year)/Price in Comparative Year]*100<br>i.e. CPI= [194-180/180]*100= 7.77%<br>And 194 cannot be 107.77% of 180.",
14505,r7JPdtYx4sg,"Easiest and simplest  explanation , anyone can understand. Thank You team think school",
14506,r7JPdtYx4sg,The most important thing people should know about &quot;Inflation&quot; is that &quot; Prices DON&#39;T GO UP&quot; ....its actually &quot;Value of Money goes down&quot; ...For Eg: 100 rupees today will buy you less goods than it used to 2 years back.....off coarse banks and govts don&#39;t like that line of thinking..to know more look up and understand how money is created. Instead of value its created out of debt. Look up &quot; Fractional Reserve Banking System&quot;,
14507,r7JPdtYx4sg,Inflation has already come down in India.  This is false report think again think school,
14508,r7JPdtYx4sg,"In the real world, after increase in home loan interest rates ,  the EMI doesn&#39;t go up ...but the bank increases the duration of the loan.",

14511,r7JPdtYx4sg,"like a catch 22 situation. probably rbi needs an ai based simulation software. oh wait, that will put all of us into a simulation.i vote for recession :|",
14512,r7JPdtYx4sg,"This is so cute. I clicked on the video just to see where Indian policy makers are going wrong. I didnt know it was a clickbait. There are many channels like this with youtube knowledge of how economy works. For them an RBI governor is an idiot and only they know the problems in the economy! There is one problem with this thesis though. This thesis assumes that there will be no increase in salary or income over the entire period of high inflation (the narrator says its high inflation, not logic). Like all the videos in this channel, nothing is researched. The cost of raw materials will also come down when the demand of the finished good itself is low, why will its cost increase when there is no demand of the final finished good, war or not? In addition, there is a question of foreigh reserves too. This channel runs on clickbaits and euphoric music to generate interest. Once the music is muted, his words make no sense",
14513,r7JPdtYx4sg,"On every point , I be like: Stop the fucking warüòÇüôÇüòê",
14514,r7JPdtYx4sg,"Honestly speaking, there is nothing to be proud of being Indian. I mean what&#39;s there to be proud about a nation which has a low gdp per capita, hdi rank of 130, low rank in innovation and competitiveness, high corruption, weak passport, disunity, religious disharmony, brain drain and many other never ending problems. In reality, people will truly feel proud of their country if it gives them economic prosperity and top quality life. Culture, history and all that crap are secondary and don&#39;t pay the bills. The overproud Indians who brag all over the internet of being proud of being Indian will dash out of India faster than light if they get a foreign visa. Talking about the army, most people join the army and other govt departments just to make money and get benefits, not out of patriotism.",

14517,r7JPdtYx4sg,So technically Inflation is always followed by Recession!!,
14518,r7JPdtYx4sg,"Why is demand seen as a limiting factor here? Increased demand will get vendors to reduce their profit margins which will be supplemented with the increased demand in market. A company may make a stable profit with higher sales, but just with a lower margin.",
14519,r7JPdtYx4sg,"Hats off man, you can&#39;t provide more simple explanation than this to learn inflation and recession",
14520,r7JPdtYx4sg,"RBI will just follow what FED will do in the USA...They dont take drastic measures themself normally....By the way why government has to worry about inflation ?....Its problem to the  common man due to price rise but a jackpot to the government.....High prices is equal to higher tax collections<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>üòä",

14529,r7JPdtYx4sg,The headline is absolutely shameful Ganesh. Who is paying you to churn out these headlines?,
14530,r7JPdtYx4sg,Its soo suprising how most Indian have no knowledge of economical system. I have no interest in politics. Modi or rbi can only control inflation so much... But in the situation such as right now when then world economy is as stable as a river.. the inflation is as same. And i dont think no matter which gov was to be in power right now the crippling inflation was unavoidable,
14531,r7JPdtYx4sg,"Using your videos to prepare for current affairs for MBA interviews. Thanks for the comprehensive information, Think School.",
14532,r7JPdtYx4sg,You opened my eyes‚ú®,
14533,r7JPdtYx4sg,Nicely explained,
14534,r7JPdtYx4sg,The fact is: STILL houses are getting sold like chocolates in Bengaluru and the market price of Home in Bengaluru is already up by 40% 2022. There is no recession when you see how Bengaluru people are buying cars and homes. I don&#39;t know what to conclude / what data is right or wrong.,
14535,r7JPdtYx4sg,Total reliance on artificial fertilizers should be reduced. Diversification of farming between organic and artificial fertilizers needed. Same goes to energy imports. There was an innovation on use of aluminium cells as battery for cars instead of litium but still no cars annouced with this eventhough aluminium is abundant in india,
14536,r7JPdtYx4sg,"India needs to enforce supply-side policies in order to reduce inflation in the long term.  I know in the short term it is going to have extreme debt for the govt, but it will help in the long term. This is my thinking as an economics student. Anyway, I love your video!! Thank you!",
14537,r7JPdtYx4sg,I got my home loan at 6.75% in may and right now I am paying 9.15%,
14538,r7JPdtYx4sg,Never realised how important Ukraine was in global production,
14539,r7JPdtYx4sg,bulk inflation has been controlled below 5 percent,
14540,r7JPdtYx4sg,The title and video are misleading. You just explained the terms and did not even go into details on why rbi is failing to control(likely reacted late like other economies). Even before going into inflation you should&#39;ve explained the money printing that happened due to covid and the supply shock after that. Here we were lucky that India didn&#39;t print money like the US and Europe which is why the inflation was higher in these countries.,
14541,r7JPdtYx4sg,Thank u for giving such informative knowledge. keep it up,

Canada and Germany screwed the turbine issue, therefore, Russia had no choice but shot down NS1. eventually both pipelines were blown up, not by Russia that&#39;s for sure. After 9 consecutive sanctions against Russia, EU heads of the Union went along with America, and screwed its self with the Boomerang, and put the blame on Russia. The heads of EU States should resign for destroying EU and wider economies due to their own stupidity by not seeing America destroying its partners as an example 4X higher prices on LNG.

14710,mDRom6ahzsA,"This video is very well made but, Here are some inherent flaws I found in this video.<br>One, it assumes that the energy costs are same everywhere in Europe. That is not the case. It varies in every country. Consequently, not every country needs to give equally high subsidies. This, combined with exceptional warm weather this season made Dutch TTF prices fall below pre invasion levels.<br>Secondly, trade inside European union is not symmetrical. Meaning countries like Greece and Italy are not producing nearly as many goods as countries like Germany, France and Poland. So, they will not and cannot risk the remaining businesses in their country by starting a trade war within European union. And truth be told, most probably all European countries import more from China and rest of the world than they do from each other. <br>And the last point. The debt to gdp ratio was mentioned. Where do you think these countries are getting this debt from? All this debt is coming from European union as a whole and hence Germany is indirectly giving money to other countries such as Greece and Italy by simply being the largest economy in the European union. <br>I would argue that the stability in Europe even after  8 or 9 months of invasion is a proof that countries in European union are actually helping each other in some ways. <br>If you really want to see how bad things can get due to high energy prices look at UK not European union. <br>Maybe this is the reason why not a single prediction made at the end of this video has come true until now. <br>I personally think that if the invasion continues, next winter will be more trying than this one. And that will be true test of the European union.",

Sadly I am not seeing any signs of land labour and judicial/ police reforms in this country, the farm bill was supposed to make our agri sector much more productive, and it was scuttled.

14900,OKQDst5GUc0,"We have seen a lot of questions in the comments section of this video. Here are the answers to the major ones:<br><br><br> <br>1. It‚Äôs difficult to control the urge to purchase for things I want. How is Multipl useful then?<br>Ans: Start using Multipl for things which are inherently plannable. Eg:, Insurance premium that you pay once every year, or birthday/anniversary gift that you can give on a specific day only. Holidays can also be planned.<br> <br> <br>2. Market Investments don‚Äôt come with any guarantee of returns. What If I lose money on my travel goal in 6 months?<br>Ans: Yes, there‚Äôs a certain degree of risk with all market-linked investments.<br><br>What Multipl offers in this case are three things:<br>1.  Allocation that are suitable as per your goal duration, your risk profile and the market analysis. They follow the framework of Safety, Liquidity along with Returns.<br>2. Rebalancing when needed: They constantly monitor your allocated portfolio and rebalance to minimize losses if the market fluctuates significantly.<br>3. Purchase protection: If at the end of your goal, you choose to make a purchase with their brand partners. So let‚Äôs say that your 6 months travel goal generates some loss in returns, they‚Äôll match it up to your principal in the form of brand savings if you go ahead and make the purchase with the brand.<br><br> <br> <br>3. How is Multipl trying to defeat delayed gratification and build a positive habit in its users?<br>Ans. Typically, people go for BNPLs despite having money to buy things is because of two reasons:<br>1. Offers <br>2. Rewards<br>Multipl has partnered with brands which gives GiftCards that can be used over and above their native offers. Wisely combined with native offers and bank offers, one can get maximum savings on these brands.<br>Secondly, they have a point system (called MBits) where you get rewarded for saving (just like you get rewarded for spending in credit cards).<br> <br> <br>4. Multipl‚Äôs business model. <br>Explained in timestamp 11.47 mins<br><br>5. Does Multipl make money out of mutual fund investments?<br>No. They only give direct mutual funds, which are by definition commission-free. <br>Moreover, Multipl does not charge a promotional fee to any AMC as they are SEBI Registered Advisors, which means they cannot promote one fund over another. <br><br>6. Will this SNBL model work?<br>Ans. Only time will tell. Multipl claims to have 300K+ installs and goals worth Rs 400 Cr+ already created on their app. That speaks volumes. <br>However, people who really want to get the best of this model will do so ‚Äì earning returns + brand savings + rewards and going debt free at the same time!<br> <br>7. Can you encash your goals earlier?<br>Multipl mentions that there is no lock-in, no penalties. So yes, you can. However, do remember that market conditions should be favourable for you so that you don‚Äôt lose money when you sell your units.<br> <br>8. Details about MCash. T&amp;Cs and more. <br>Please check the app for every individual brand detail.",
14901,OKQDst5GUc0,Bs bs hadd se jada krdiye ho promotion,

14915,OKQDst5GUc0,The only problem here is our investment is spent on our liabilities rather than our assets. There would still be a regrets while spending on trips while using SNPL scheme meanwhile it&#39;s a great opportunity for students who want to save money for their higher education.,

14929,OKQDst5GUc0,Goal-based investment is a stupid idea. It does not work since the market is unpredictable. You should invest for the sake of investment and maximize your long-term gains.,
14930,OKQDst5GUc0,Why would I use multipl for SIP to buy mutual fund units when I can do this manually( through any other broker)?<br>How is this different from just another investment instrument?,
14931,OKQDst5GUc0,"There literally no advantage of having access to small ticket loans. Just use cash or UPI payments. It is true that the markets do expand if you give access to credit, but it is at the expense of the consumer. No one needs 18000 rupees worth Jordan shoes, no one. Especially someone who earns only 50k per month.",
14932,OKQDst5GUc0,The main reason why BNPL works is because people are trigger happy. Asking a BNPL customer to become SNPL customer is basically asking the person to change himself/herself. It&#39;s not practical.,

How is that good business. If you don&#39;t take care of you employees why should they give their all back to a company where money is more important the their employees security? Right now Indigo Air is the last air line I would trust with my safety. I&#39; d pay a bit more to the competition if they guarantee my safety and that of their air and ground crews,

15016,7QOLDRY_Uk4,I have heard that Indigo employs female flight crew as opposed to male crew which brings down the weight of the flight by atleast 50 kgs. Saves fuel in the long run. Also the crew collects the trash even before the plane touches down leading to faster turn around...,

But, still while Airlines in India have mounting losses, the European and North American airlines are either breaking even or making a Profit.

One of the Vegetable vendor near our home started Home-delivery (This may be common in urban areas but wasn&#39;t in our location). And within months, he became the only vegetable vendor our entire area had. <br><br>Now, this vendor has always been there, even pre-COVID but we never bought from him as though nice quality - his prices were a bit high compared to others but since others couldn&#39;t adapt to the paradigm shift and he did, we all now only buy from him as he delivers at door-step and this convenience he provided realizing the opportunity was his success.  <br><br>He now has 6 delivery persons hired. And while due to busy orders, his phone was always busy for calls, he also started taking orders on Whatsapp!

Poverty is a deep rooted economic and social and culture problem that needs every bit of efforts that the whole society has to alleviate. So the question is: does Indians as a country care about its poor people, truly care so that they are ready to pour in valuable resources to help them, from kid nutrition, to education, to creating jobs with dedicated skill training, and building infrastructure for them that you know that will loose money. Without all these, poverty alleviation will happen, but slowly and slowly.

15631,NM-WadrQqWE,"The Banking system in India is still not catering to those who actually need it. I‚Äôll site my own example. In 2015, after I completed my post graduation, I needed loan to open my own clinic. The loan wasn‚Äôt so big that the Bank had to fear a default, around 12 lacs! <br>Now I was a fresh pass out from my residency. I had no income tax history. The Banks like SBI advertised that for doctor they are providing doctors loan of Rs 35 lacs without any collateral guarantee!! Now when I went to the Bank, I did all my paper work, submitted everything that was required . The banks never called me back on their own. For next 12 months I kept going to bank visiting the bank manager, who kept giving excuses that it‚Äôs stuck in higher center, sometimes they would say one more document is required which the forgot ‚Ä¶ now in the meanwhile one of their criteria for loan was that I should have a valid rent agreement for my clinic premises. Now I had rented a place for the clinic for that purpose. Now imaging for next 12 months I did not get the loan to start the clinic. But I paid monthly rent of the space without generating any income!! . So I paid rent for 12 months. After more than 12 months. I filed my first income tax file. When I submitted that. Only then My loan was granted!! So you see, even though the advertisement we‚Äôre given for loan without any income proof, but the final decision lies on the branch manager. If one does not the branch manager well, or branch manager does not have confidence in you, you will not get the loan. Now after 8 years of practice, the bank managers keep calling me or come physically to my clinic asking me if I have any requirements. The fact that I am a safe client, they are now more than willing!!! This is the story of Indian Banking system!!! It caters to those who have money and want to earn more money!!! But not for those who are in lower income bracket and want to uplift their finances",

( I think only students credit card scheme is not popular otherwise all other schemes are promoting and adopting by people quickly) sometimes we need money not for only small education expenses or agriculture expense or small health expenses but in home other works also which are not specify and we don&#39;t have small loan for these otherwise from education to agriculture to health to buisness government is giving credit card for small loans to big big loans also so indian government is doing well than expected very well",

These examples illustrate people in difficult/ neck to neck  financial condition but it does not reflect the poor of the country. Also the example assumes people in big cities with access to job market. The real situation is however, very different. <br>First the country has to be seen at two layers of urban and rural India, because I do not think the situations faced by residents in either are similar. Then there are layers in both of India&#39;s, layers of poverty and mind that both India would have substantially different layers as the living expenses and potential opportunities are different. <br>Using this as a base, maybe you guys should do this video again. I wish ending poverty was this easy but in the end, it&#39;s all about creating opportunities for people to develop into. As an example, this ITI trainings started by predecessor govt, were amazing tools for people to acquire skills. Probably we need schemes like these to also enter various layers and mind it again, they cannot be the same for all layers.",

We should not at least let that happen.",
15805,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Hi,¬†<br><br><br>I am going to highlight a thing at which nobody so far has noticed. It‚Äôs about ethical turned unethical practices of a Indian reputed firm so called ‚ÄúZomato‚Äù. The era of food delivery at home started around a decade ago which soon started becoming popular among one an all eventually and now almost is a name on each and everybody‚Äôs mouth. Myself, also being a very big foodie started availing Zomato‚Äôs delivery service sitting home which was an awesome experience in starting years. Food delivery those days was costing not much expensive. Zomato‚Äôs surcharges from their partner restaurant which usually includes commission, tax on commission, and other minor charges which cumulatively summed up t0 17-19 % in till the years of 2019-20. Then pandemic changed everything and spared not business / person however It‚Äôs Zomato who fed every needy individual while sitting at home. This model was very much appreciated during those days and it was hugely considered by everyone that Zomato is the future of the outside food but nobody then knew the dark truth to be come in time to come.¬†<br><br>Before all this story I would like to introduce myself briefly. I‚Äôm 36 years old individual qualified as a Chemical Engineer with working experience of 10+ years. My last jobs were with reputed companies i.e. JSW group, Toranagallu, Karnataka (Epsilon Carbon) and Tata Chemicals, Mithapur Salt plant (through third party) and my last drawn salary was 9.36 Lakh per annum. After a long span of living a family life in these remote areas and meanwhile pandemic effects on job market made me awake to enter into cloud kitchen business which used to be my passion. I took a huge risk leaving my job aside and started a cloud kitchen after trying for around 8-9 months. I had no lack of passion and was not at all scared of hard work. I was very much confident about my abilities and experience which I assumed will help me grow in the business. Zomato for me then was just you, I or anyone else know about.<br><br>My online food selling business started in May 2022 after documental formalities. Till that date, Zomato‚Äôs commission (including everything) officially was rose to 27% which is a lion‚Äôs share in profit. When we talk about eateries (restaurants, food stalls, street food stalls, Thelewala), 70% of the business even don‚Äôt manage to earn (say take home wages) this much amount to their home (27%).¬†<br><br>Now the story comes to Zomato.¬†<br><br>Earlier we used to go outside physically at restaurant to have our food whenever we wanted to do. Zomato eventually changed the picture and made things easy. Although, people merely experienced when their meal plate became costlier like anything in very short time span. Due to this Zomato‚Äôs huge commission restaurants started hiking their price by 30-35% which was substantial amount in this short period. A person who was getting average meal for say i.e. at INR 150 + taxes + delivery charge) which may be approximate INR 175,¬† he started getting the same food Rs. 250 or even more.¬†<br><br>If restaurant tries to maintain the hiked price to make sale balanced, he falls in great loss.¬†<br><br>27% commission and taxes too just a myth. Restaurant encourages or simply speaking blackmails restaurants to do participate in promotional programmes which are chargeable schemes. It means if restaurants don‚Äôt participate in programmes, their visibility on Zomato app will be as poor as that restaurant will hardly get a couple of orders in a day. Now the actual expenditure on Zomato ad comes into picture. They have customized many plans and schemes to be opted by restaurant partners. Big daddys in restaurant business can afford and select high package schemes whereas even a ordinary package is costlier for a common food service provider though no option left but to go with ad scheme. It indirectly adds an additional average 5%¬† load of 27% discount summing it to 33%.¬†<br><br>The story doesn‚Äôt even end here. Unethical practices from Zomato leave the businessmen in no way unturned to earn his bread and butter. Every now and then, Zomato sends a mail to their restaurant partners that they are starting a campaign where restaurant‚Äôs visibility will be made higher on Zomato food delivery app for which they have to opt for their scheme in which restaurant has to provide a discount to customer. This discounted amount is completely borne by restaurant however Zomato never highlights the same and takes all the credit of discount by Zomato itself from customers. A dirty reality is that customer always thinks that the discount being offered is by Zomato but not by restaurant. I some case if under-priced food, any complaint is raised by customer which comes in the form of review / ratings which directly affect restaurant‚Äôs overall image and rating. However up to this it‚Äôs fine but in some cases spam ratings also take place for which Zomato never let restaurant speak directly to customer due to which their probability of making the repeated mistake can be nullified.<br><br>As mentioned above, these promotional campaign sometimes are imposed without authorization of restaurant. Restaurant comes to know on this when a lot of orders are already gone. These discount promos are operated by Zomato itself hence can‚Äôt be stopped by self. It takes 2-3 days after your complaint to get the promo offer stopped. Till the same time, you have no other option left with you to do. First is to turning the restaurant off on Zomato (which negatively impacts the image of restaurant on customers) and other is to bear the losses of unauthorized discounts (unwillingly but only to show the restaurant open). Due to policies made by Zomato, if we reject the order in this case, visibility of restaurant becomes so poor that restaurant may not receive new customer orders for couple of days. This thing has been experienced by me 4-5 times in last few months, and subsequently Zomato has not compensated for losses anytime or eben not bothered to revert on raised tickets.<br><br>Next point is that Zomato is so unethical that many restaurant which are getting continuous negative rating however managed to maintain the restaurant rating as 4+ on app. It doesn‚Äôt apply for common restaurants who are not capable to pay heft ransom in form of paid ads. Zomato doesn‚Äôt share its algorithm methodology (confidential as per Zomato) which they use for restaurant‚Äôs overall rating calculation and on the basis of same they are not all bothered to answer your restaurant‚Äôs rating improvement. Overall rating on Zomato is a main factor depending upon which the sales is dependant. I tried no stone unturned to improve my retuarant‚Äôs rating by getting maximum 5 stars however failed to improve because Zomato is not all bothered to answer.<br><br>Each and every query is raised in form of tickets to Zomato. Its replied with customized and computerized mails and tickets are closed furher. There is no direct telephonic link to talk to Zomato anytime in <a href=""http://need.in/"">need.In</a> this case we feel nothing but helpless.¬†<br><br>8 out of 10 restaurants are being closing every year but now I came to know that 4 of them are deserving but are victims of business based corruption say monopolization / duopolization.<br><br>Surprisingly, there is no proper authority is controlling these firm. This is directly affecting consumers. The days are not far when food will not be in plates. It will be in small bowls.¬†<br><br>The above content is a brief article that I would like to convey to you in hope that it will be highlighted and brought to consumers. The time is not far when Zomato will be a modern franchise version of EAST INDIA COMPANY. I‚Äôm already at the verge of closing my kitchen but before that I want to let the reality come in everybody‚Äôs knowledge.<br><br>Many more things are there which I‚Äôm not highlighting in this short mail.<br><br>Support data on my mails can be produced if any action is likely to be taken from your end.<br><br>Lastly, I would only like to say,<br><br><br>SAVE YOUR PLATE.",
15806,fTuVWwTQegQ,By laying off their employees,
15807,fTuVWwTQegQ,Food delivery is not a profitable business unless someone invents teleporting in the next few years. The razor thin margins is not enough to attract investors interest and the same also means small changes in costs can severely flip a profit making company to a loss making one,

15832,fTuVWwTQegQ,Government has to come up with appropriate Laws to protect small offline business,
15833,fTuVWwTQegQ,YouTube has a nice sense of humour,
15834,fTuVWwTQegQ,I think zomato loses most of its revenue in relentless advertisement.,
15835,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Even if Zomato YOY accumulate losses and at end go to IBC and declaring bankrupt doesn&#39;t affect deepinder Goyal at all because to setup a Zomato like company is not a big deal, it&#39;s assets are merely 100 crores , liquidation will be of only brand name and value, he can very easily setup another food agreegator model company after its delisting. Because whatever he has to earn he earned when he launched IPO and in Blinkkit acquisition which is friends company.",
15836,fTuVWwTQegQ,Zomato share has now fallen 75%. People see these kind of stupid videos and lose their hard earned money. Respect the market. This guy considers himself the smartest person in the world.,
15837,fTuVWwTQegQ,Today zomato traded @41 rs. FunkU.,

15845,fTuVWwTQegQ,"After charging 28% &amp; forcing vendors 15 to 20% as marketing expenses to push an outlet to go up the list, takes no participation in promos, no accountability in failed deliveries, no investments in delivery vehicles, no salaries to delivery ppl, push vendors to offer massive discounts whereby the vendors are actually making a loss on food cost. They still manage to post a loss of 1500 cr. All the money goes towards corporate rent, massive salaries, business class flights at the cost of the vendors.",
15846,fTuVWwTQegQ,So afterall Zomato was not a gold mine investment.. and nor is this guy&#39;s analysis however coherent the story sounds to be,

15861,fTuVWwTQegQ,My friend the so called &#39;Every single expert and fundamental analyst&#39; that you were taunting is right and &#39;You&#39; are wrong about zomato. More than one year on Zomato is still burning invester cash and just getting worse,
15862,fTuVWwTQegQ,note it down. Zomato is never going to be profitable. Any investor buying stocks watching this shit is down 60% or even more. This video came right before IPO. You r just making fool out of people. Its just the game of valuation. Stock market shows u the reality.,
15863,fTuVWwTQegQ,I so want to believe in the Zomato growth story. For the past few weeks I am up-skilling so that I can contribute to Zomato&#39;s journey. But the very fact that the promoters hold 0% shares makes me feel it as a landmine. Do you have any take on this?,
15864,fTuVWwTQegQ,This is conjecturing- In house brands suck and Bed Bath Beyond is the latest victim to this. We all know these in house products are not the same as brand ones,
15865,fTuVWwTQegQ,Everyone knows how zomato will become profitable except the management of zomato.,
15866,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Maybe it‚Äôs not a GOLD MINE. I have lost trust on any of the recent IPOs cause all are just burning money given by VC to increase valuation, go public and dump it all on naive retailers :)",
15867,fTuVWwTQegQ,"Amazon has practically monopoly over ecommerce. Zomato doesn&#39;t over cloud kitchen. Data alone doesn&#39;t makes investment opportunity. Making proper utilisation is.

15876,fTuVWwTQegQ,It is not easy to copy the food compared electronic items..in food people need variety nobody orders from same place every day..everyone needs different food and different brand .even if Zomato copies the food and taste it will be branded as Zomato food not McDonald&#39;s or KFC or any other restaurants,

You can already see there is huge cost difference between the home order and when you visit restaurant... I have already reduced my orders online for two reasons... One it&#39;s expensive to eat at home and you don&#39;t have feeling of restaurant food... Amazon is still not able to make decent ac or tv (see their rating in Amazon itself) forget about indian food quality... We can&#39;t make food homogeneous..,

15885,fTuVWwTQegQ,Imagine if you own a profitable restaurant or any business for almost 10 years and suddenly the landlord kicks you out and he runs the same business with a different name. <br>Not all have some ethics like Tata.  Some new regulations in this will help a lot of SMEs.,

15976,6GWm2OyekXY,"Absolutely right. I have been always against this philosophy. The very idea of putting your health last for sake of &quot;success&quot; is wrong.

16013,t-VpFrqd0W0,"Good insight about Metaverse. While out of my curiosity , I have read and listened few other sources about Metaverse - people gave out their imagination how this is going to be used .. <br><br>One among them which I felt amazing is:<br><br>A specialized surgeon who generally visits other places currently occasionally &#39;coz of travelling issue - will be able to contribute now through Metaverse easily. In an operation theatre along with the doctors performing - this surgeon can be present as an avatar - go around 360 degrees to get the exact understanding and guide the performing doctors what need to be done.<br><br>No Technology is good or bad as per me - it&#39;s all about how we make use of it. Same would be with metaverse also.<br><br>I would look forward for a video from you - which talks about possible business opportunities using metaverse .",

16015,t-VpFrqd0W0,Plz do Fundamental analysis of KPR Mills,
16016,t-VpFrqd0W0,All current tech and social media would become history as soon as it reaches the majority. One of it&#39;s advantages would be kill of social media sites and it&#39;s negative mental effects,
16017,t-VpFrqd0W0,example - Nuclear Power when discovered was first used to create the Atom Bomb not Power Plants....So its always subjective and on us only how we use the knowledge. If we are good people we will for a case like the NGO use case and if we are going bad or run away from reality we become similar to what Surrogates movie showcased,

16052,t-VpFrqd0W0,Meta Verse is only helpful for specific area.(not for daily use ),
16053,t-VpFrqd0W0,Metaverse  is a waste of time. It will put more and more people indoors which will have a negative affect on the mental and emotional health. Well time will tell how and where this technology will take mankind. Second life was a prime example of such metaverse failure. Just my thoughts.,
16054,t-VpFrqd0W0,"The potential negative consequences far exceed the positive ones. Considering how woefully ill equipped governments are at regulating tech, the negative consequences are going to dominate. Just look at how divided society has become as social media grew in adoption.",

And By the way, attrition rate is not going to come down because of a virtual world meeting sessions. It depends on factors like money ,work culture etc.. And, a toxic work culture will feel even more toxic in virtual world where senses are high. Your video is good but with wrong analogies. You need to get a real world office job to understand how actually project deliverables happen in office. Your Teaching sessions job is not going to help understand these things.",

16172,fnO6UfeplxE,"Any one who has achieved a top position if we look at, they reached there through their talent, handwork and feedback system they built - But, unfortunately what happens is after certain time - the feedback system doesn&#39;t work &#39;as initially - let me put my point through an example<br><br>A famous director who has given 5 block busters .. Imagine how much thought process would have gone into during story finalization, script making, shooting , post production etc., Every time while the director discusses with his feedback channel - initially there is every possibility the channel would be coming out with their views, thoughts, apprehensions towards the decisions taken etc.,<br><br>But as no one know which will work - finally they will be agreeing at some point and in that there would be enough places where they may have not felt fully convinced with the director. But, when they see those areas well accepted by audience and movies become hit one after one - the feedback channel gets to a stage knowingly or unknowingly that the director thought process is right than what they are thinking and they may not be giving feedback in the same way they used to do initially.<br><br>That&#39;s why we see successful directors, leaders, entrepreneurs do commit mistakes at their peak stager. Therefore having a feedback system and refining that every now and then is equally important. <br><br>Nice topic chosen Ganesh... Can you sometime write what inspires you to come out with such topics and how do you actually research to make such informative and engaging consent. Thanks in advance",

Indeed the dmart offers significant discount by boosting it sales, hence they get more discounts from vendors in regular basis. I would like to add few more points where dmart earns revenue in following areas.<br><br>1) They have private lables which are competitors for high sale product, The dmart either manufacture or market those products and they will be placed those products next to competitive product. ( Ex Mazza- Mango merry, Nescafe - Lecafe, Harpic - Force 10,etc; the products packing are so similar, sometimes even the regular customers can&#39;t differentiate) Since they market/ manufacture this products they are quite cheap compared to the competitive products.<br><br>2) Loose Grocery contributes 23% of daily stores Revenue. Since they obtain the large quantity of Groceries from farmers.( Eliminating the middle men) <br><br>3) Cross Merchandising<br>4) Plastic and glass items are importing from china and rebranding.<br><br><br>Thanks for the wonderful case study Think School, They are so informative..",

16619,3tVoKZ5pHMU,Not applicable to IIT&#39;s,
16620,3tVoKZ5pHMU,"Because of an inordinate and rigid emphasis on grades, our education system is training students to write and excel at exams. Education always looks to the past in order to preserve the past. It concerns itself with &quot;what was and what is&quot; as against &quot;what could be&quot;. Curiosity,  exploration and creativity ( hallmark of childhood) are systematically killed in schools. Analytical thinking , while necessary, isn&#39;t adequate to address problems in a world that&#39;s changing at unprecedented speed. Our pupils have become competent at breaking down a problem,  identifying chains of cause and effect and describing it. An overwhelming majority of them use word &quot;because&quot; excessively. That&#39;s all there is. No encouragement for asking &quot;why not&quot; as it smacks of rebellion and challenge to status quo. Pity that &quot;why not&quot; has the seeds of creative new ideas. &quot;Because&quot; is descriptive - it cannot lead to new ideas. &quot;Why not&quot; is generative - it leads to new creation. High time we introduced Design from standard 8, as it can train pupils to leave aside the obvious and work toward non-standard, unconventional solutions.",

16648,3tVoKZ5pHMU,One of the best lecture we missed in our engineering times !,
16649,3tVoKZ5pHMU,"There is one more important point<br>Which everyone ignores <br>Literally everyone<br>In school colleges importance is given to theory part not practical ,,<br>Reading this feels soo silly isn&#39;t it , oki let me give you an example,<br>Few years back we had computer subject in <a href=""http://b.com/"">b.com</a> and our lecturer taught us html which was basics of coding and no one knew that we were learning coding literally,, our fault was we didn&#39;t learn properly we didn&#39;t attend cls regularly but the mistake of our lecturer was there was not a single practical class with a computer , we wudve know wat we were learning, and the fun fact is our cls topper didn&#39;t even know that it was just a basics of coding, <br>Practical is more important than theory. <br>Practical is the best way to learn anything in a fastest way ,<br>If we can&#39;t apply a particular thing in our life to see how it works then only we should focus on theory....",

I just know that I got a degree that just BE passed.<br>3. In 3rd year 5th sem college placement training, again they are going with very small introduction of DB, C, Java, aptitude to get placement I have sit there to get placement in company. But you know what happens I didn&#39;t sit any placements not any single company. Why because I don&#39;t know what is engineering? That question I asked many times to myself. I have searched for books where I realised  that I am not qualified for engineering.<br>4. You know when I got to know about engineering subjects when I prepared for GATE, then I got real understanding how engineer thinks. <br>5. You are telling right every engineering college is became a business. There aim is to get as many as admission and to make lots of money but not making student to realise his full potential.

16706,I9p5K2Ke2MA,"It&#39;s your understanding or limited perspective of the experience of Microsoft that what Microsoft does is Exterminate its competitors. In reality, Microsoft NEVER does this, and it does not need to do this.<br>Microsoft never capitalizes and invests and supports the products of the present or the future. What it does is use the past as a means to grow the future. What do I mean by this? Consider Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Azure(especially LUIS inside Azure) and Power BI.<br>All these products are not the requirement of the present (like what google does) and they are neither what will be wanted (NOT &quot;REQUIRED&quot;) in the future (like the way Meta invested heavily in AR and VR). What Microsoft does is it remodel the things which were required in the past and offer it in the present. By past, I mean replacing a document as words written on paper by Typewriter FROM and WITH Microsoft Office 365. This is how Microsoft creates and crafts it&#39;s market share. And this is also why companies like Google or Meta or Apple can never beat Microsoft.<br>The only reason why so many products that are being offered by Microsoft fail is because of the fact that the past will be liked by people in the present only when and which and by(NOT &#39;through&#39;) a form of an art, like music or work of an artist, or something else similar to being an artist.<br>Steve Jobs is channeling the art of the future into the present, whereas Bill Gates is transforming the past into the art of the past into the present. I wrote &#39;past&#39; twice with respect to Bill Gates because the past cannot be channeled straight away. First, that past has to be transformed. Then, after the transformation of that past into the present, this transformation of the past known as the present has to be turned into an (NOT &quot;THE&quot; ART)art.<br>This is why Bill Gates is so confused when he sees the present trends. He cannot make sense of the art of the past in present.<br>In order for Microsoft to be successful, it has to capture a fair share of the market through this logic. This logic will be applicable in each and every successful product of Microsoft.<br>I can simplify this logic. In order for Microsoft to create a successful product, it has to use the product or service successful in the past as a means to achieve bliss(PURE ENJOYMENT) in the present while discarding the thoughts of the future(the thoughts of the future need to be discarded because they are the obstacle in achieving bliss). Let&#39;s take an example of a wheel. Let&#39;s say Microsoft wants to use the concept of the past, the WHEEL into the present and use it to create wealth.<br>The wheel is a means to ease the transportation of objects from one place to another. Say, Microsoft wants to create a software helping people involved in the supply chain. Then, this software will eliminate all the obstacles that have occurred when something had to be transported. What would be the root of the obstacle in transporting something? It would be, transporting it and not teleporting it. To achieve bliss, you have to teleport it. This is why Microsoft creates a supply chain software where only those things would appear through which you would feel that the product is teleported. And you will find the same logic in one of the top 3 leading software which eases the supply chain.<br>And the entire thing in the para behind this statement is written by someone who knows love as well as who as psychopathic tendencies. Because he has made both the past and future collide with the present, while being a witness of the witness.",

They focus more on features they think are useful rather than how can they solve actual human problems. Steve Jobs had the mind to do it. Nowadays Apple is just a money minting machine. They can&#39;t earn through ads, hence they charge more for their product (Security is a plus point to this).<br>Now they are limited to the Apple ecosystem, but a player like Google is working hard to be as efficient as possible in the software space and available to everyone. Disadvantage: Google uses your data for ads. If you see older I/Os, you will see how Sundar Pichai explains every rollout, what motivated them and what was the problem statement. Apple will survive only on hardware quality and few brand loyalists.",
17073,C2tjnJOy7Hw,Everything that is making Apple money was left behind by Steve Jobs. Tim Cook&#39;s initiatives since taking power has been to make Apple a diverse and inclusive company.

We don&#39;t know what it is. Just like how digital camera killed Kodak or electric cars are going to kill a host of car manufacturers.<br>To Apple&#39;s credit it created the smart phone market, it created the concept of an eco-system, it killed the music labels business. Don&#39;t know what next.",
17077,C2tjnJOy7Hw,Apple devices since the start are very expensive. One I phone costs at least  4 or 5 samsung devices together. One macbook cost equals at least 2 laptops of compaq/ hp/ fujitsu,

Netflix relies on new content and almost all of it&#39;s new content is made with a liberal agenda which irks its customers who do not want to be preached to. Disney and other giants are also doing something similar, but at least they have ownership of older material which was not pandering to only one section of society or have ownership of moneymaking franchises like Marvel which are breaking new grounds in storytelling. Viewers are spoiled for choices and in fact, do not mind streaming through multiple services so long as content is unique and entertaining. Netflix is missing both kinds of content.",

Netflix is a customer  to Amazon ! Why ? Because Netflix uses AWS (Amazon Web services) to store and retrieve it&#39;s content.

There is always going to be air pollution some way or the other but we need to preserve our soil as there isn&#39;t any alternative for it !. The whole EV saga has been started by US by spreading fake narratives about how good EV&#39;s will be for the environment which is quite the opposite. In reality ,the main reason why this narrative is being pushed through media is because US is running out of oil and countries like Russia have abundance of oil &amp; gas , therefore, in order to stay relevant they had to come up with some brainwashing , hence the EV !",

Petrol is a cash cow for any Govt. in India and it is foolish to think that any govt will think about their country first and then about their ‚Äòchair‚Äô. Its a universal truth. This high custom duty on EVs and the fact that EV is still not in the green energy list of the govt. is a clear indication tht our govt. will try, as much as it can, to discourage EVs. But they know sooner or later the international community will put pressure on our govt. to reduce custom duty and promote EVs.

17291,ERN8MZl-2pw,"In my opinion why ppl are hesitant for EV are the Electricity cost.....whatever you have mentioned is just the base cost for 1 unit of electricity that too I assume is without the other fixed cost that are charged by the Discoms. Also the fixed charges are based on slabs which means  more the electricity consumed more will be the per unit cost also the fixed cost will increase thereby increase tje overall per unit cost. Plus once EV becomes a mainstream the demand for electricity will also increase thereby again raising the cost + this will pave the road for Discoms to exploit the customers, I&#39;ve myself experienced during lockdown the threatening nature of discoms",

17571,EUcVBDtJo5M,"Having seen few of your videos, I come to the conclusion that most views are biased on how you view things based on perception than actual statistics as you have omitted in many. Todays, Creds revenue comparison with that of Jio, is a tactful manipulation to infuse a hypothetical idea. In comparison of Amazons warehouse and Reliance small stores, you never identified the costing related to both, but simply stuck to the idea of delivering the packet on a scooter. What in case of a sofa set return? As in the Ambani case, everyone knows Friends of Reliance, but what made him a dark house is how he routed the funds and also made a <br>killing !",

17578,EUcVBDtJo5M,"Hi Ganesh, First of all thanks for making such great informative videos which is a really good content for our youth fraternity. keep the great work up. Here are the few things which I beg to differ that you compare Jio with Cred,  Customer acquisition - Jio all together come up with a new product that is 4G LTE which doesn&#39;t support 3G smart phone that&#39;s why they roll out for free to navigate customer from 3G to 4G smart phone where 1GB data was costing around 300 rupees, Business hold - Jio had invested heavily which was around 1.5 lakh crores and to get break even for that they are supposed to have a certain number of customer to maintain the price point and with the investment of 1.5 lakh crores of rupees, they have created entry barrier for the other new players in same business also the initial investment was so high the existing player can&#39;t change their strategy as they were already heavily invested in 3G infrastructure which doesn&#39;t hold true with players like Cred where any new player can enter at any point of time and again they will start cash burn which lead to shift of customer as it is a digital product. So here is the big question about the sustainability of the business.",

17589,EUcVBDtJo5M,"Try permanently deleting your Cred account. It is not easy.<br><br>I stopped using Cred because: <br>- I have auto debit enabled for credit card payment from savings account. So Cred it not required at first place.<br>- It asks for full email account permission to read the statements automatically. No option to upload the statement manually or forward the statement to some email address. So I was not using this feature.<br>- Used to get ‚Çπ20 to ‚Çπ30 cashback per billing cycle for paying through Cred which did not seem like a big incentive for sharing my financial details. Cred needs to have access to my SMS in order to automatically fetch the bill amount, which is again a concern.<br><br>Overall, Cred doesn&#39;t honor privacy as much as one would have like. And one app which I can live without.<br><br>I like your videos. But this one was a bit misleading. People can live without Cred and they are better off staying away from it.",

17592,EUcVBDtJo5M,"What is this guy smoking?? Pretty sure Kunal wasn&#39;t sitting there thinking of a problem to solve. He was rather looking at how to make money. Don&#39;t let all this jargon fool you, he is doing the same thing everyone is doing. That is, Taking peoples data and making money from it. They are not going to alter any damn behavior, people will still keep taking loans and get into debt. Ofcourse they will give cashbacks, if im making money off of your data i have to give you something to sleep better at night right? stop equating a one stop dashboard for credit card payments to google maps and other solutions which changed peoples life for the good. CRED is just a quick way for another one of these money minded preneurs to make money in the cracks rather than bringing real value and changing common Indians&#39; lives.

17613,ebxaYgw8Nfw,"Indian Airline industry leaders need to understand that Airline runs because of their employees hard work, they work in a highly regulated industry where they need to maintain their licences through regular Traing and checks no other industry has as many annual proficiency checks. Also being a service industry you are not privileged to have Saturday, Sunday and festival holidays, need to sacrifice on many social events. Unfortunately in India we have no worth mentioning labour laws and regulations to protect their pay and allowances of the employees, so it is very essential for top management to focus on ethical values to protect their subordinates before self, especially at times of business financial crises. Aviation Industry like all industry goes through the ups and downs but this industry being very cash intensive and dependent on multiple vendor support system, cash flow management needs follow a tight prescribed channel leaving no chance for diversion cash out of the system, diversion of funds from system is a recipe disaster. There is a need to consistently to find, evaluate and implement new strategies to reduce operational cost rather than taking easy step of pay cuts and retrenchment, for this the management has to have a minimum Business Management qualification, more so on aviation management, just in case a particular person needs to be positioned and promoted for management post at least ensure he goes through executive management course or send him on deputation to good airlines to learn integrities of management so that he or she becomes more contributing in his or her new role, why just depend on job learning. Manage Airline to make it profitable so you take care of your unassuming, hard working employees who in many cases are single bread earners of the family.",

17768,XZxQtzUi6d8,Singapore 50 years ago may not have huge land or population or resources but they had the greatest asset and that is it had a Chinese ethnicity majority population at about 80% of the population.

I was buying Zara womenswear extensively as they were very affordable, I can afford more items and the bright colours of the outfits while most of the other fashion retailers were playing safe with blue, grey, black, white, beige etc. I personally believe it&#39;s Zara who changed that and Brough more confidence to women when they were dressed in bold and bright colours and make them stand out from the crowd. Though the quality of their items are medium I still have a handful of items that have lasted over 5 years and still in a great condition. I have changed my strategy now. I&#39;ve reduced the number of items I buy and being very selective as well. I now mix and match Zara items with better quality and pricier pieces of clothing so it doesn&#39;t look like from Zara.",

Because our teachers will hand out all these questions and worlkload tends to get a lot since a part of the portion of the syllabus is rushed during the last week before exams actually start .<br>There seems to be no benfit in just brainlessly copying questions and answers .

18660,cWsxSP3KGvs,Nicely articulated.... breaking the status quo by bringing in changes.<br>High time this happens in our legal system to bring Order in the society and punishing the wrongdoers,
18661,cWsxSP3KGvs,Aap ka naam kya hai? <br>Sounds nice when you add Hindi snippets. Keep it up,
18662,cWsxSP3KGvs,That questing thing happen to me many times....every time I would ask something teacher start shouting,
18663,cWsxSP3KGvs,One more policy he included.....Let indian think that English is better than their language and they will lose their cultural and moral education.,
18664,cWsxSP3KGvs,"But most students don&#39;t know why they are studying English, Hindi, Maths, Science, and Social Science. Learning with zero application is an absolute waste of 17 or 18 years of schooling. It is the problem! Blaming the &quot;education system&quot; is just a silly excuse! No education system will ever be perfect. Let&#39;s get over it and do something practical or go extinct in a thousand years. The choice is clear, I suppose. üòÜüòÜüòÜ",
18665,cWsxSP3KGvs,Waiting for implementation....,
18666,cWsxSP3KGvs,‚ô•Ô∏èthis video has so much value to it. <br>tq,
18667,cWsxSP3KGvs,We need to be optimistic and pessimistic at the same time to actually be able to come up with solutions to the problems in the education system and rectify mistakes. I disagree with you on choosing either optimism or pessimism. Both are required.,
18668,cWsxSP3KGvs,"I have done masters in mechanical engineering. The saddest part is that after MTech, my only 2 gateways were either to join a Research lab as an associate or to get into lecturing. The only way to upscale my career option later was to do a phd, yet have no industrial exposure. <br>You are right, a person who teaches engineering students himself/herself is unemployable.",
18669,cWsxSP3KGvs,These changes are required since so long. Good the current government is taking this and hope the transition happens fast.,
18670,cWsxSP3KGvs,I appreciate your analysis . As a teacher I consider myself good but the even the college education where I teach is designed by University which has no practical applications. So why blame the British . They taught us English which has made us relevant in many countries. Blame the government which sat ducks  on an education system with no direction or vision. The teacher has no say in matters here as to what must be taught and how. We must look at the positives not negatives. The real question is how long are we taking to design our curriculum to s relavant model and how. This applies a cross every aspect of our education. No teacher participation in curriculum formation and mo broad vision. It&#39;s time we realize science and arts are not wo tight compartments. Google was designed by the tech and an artist after all.,
18671,cWsxSP3KGvs,Education system<br><br>19th century    syllabus<br>20th century    Teachers<br>21th century     Students,
18672,cWsxSP3KGvs,Only children born with good IQ make  it to the mark &amp; become Sundar Pichais ..but majority don&#39;t because of Indian education policy based on Orthodox British education system which was meant to produce  only office clerks.  <br>So when will Indian education policy produce a million sundar Pichais ? <br><br>First thing the NEP should enforce is that no Home-work should be forced on children because of which children spend hours  just  to copy paste &amp;  somehow submit the homework &amp;  after school hours let&#39;s say  if there is  homework even for just  6 subjects then a student spends minimum 6  to 9 hours in just writing &amp; filling pages  of  book  without reading or understanding the subject matter &amp; this is the reason most students are not sucucesfull in the later part of their life . and then we say when will India have a Microsoft or a Tesla or a Google.  India does not have a Elon musk or a Bill gates etc because  Indian education encouragees Mug-up culture and are producing crores  &amp; crores of  non thinkers who may pass university  exams but miserably fail  in competative entrance exams.  Why? Because Indian education only suits or is meant for children born with good or high IQ but what about the rest.  ?<br><br>Moreover since the student spends  many hours in  just  filling pages without reading the subject as the student does not get time plus because the student spends all his or her after  school-hours  time in non productive homework so the student does not get time to play or engage in extra circular activities.<br> So as a nation what kind of youth are we producing . As a nation India is producing non-productive..non physically fit youth who cannot compete  &amp; such a non competative youth population  start  taking  short cuts and so compromise on merrit &amp; so India has become a nation of non meritorious population &amp;  how can such a indian society  of non-meritorious   citizens    create a positive &amp; secure future for India.   This vicious cycle which is the DNA of the current  Indian education system must be broken to produce not a few sundar Pichais or Satya nadellas  but India needs a million sundar pichais..&amp; satya nadellas &amp; Vishwanathan  anand  else India will be a slave nation dependent on other nations just  to survive but not to prosper.,
18673,cWsxSP3KGvs,I like this NEP..&amp;good explanation buddy,
18674,cWsxSP3KGvs,Keep up good work.,
18675,cWsxSP3KGvs,Being a researcher and a Teacher are 2 different domains. Teaching is talent so  researching.,

18677,cWsxSP3KGvs,"this is my scepticism towards the new education policy. the target of this policy on gross enrollment ratio in higher education is 50% whereas the present national average is 25<br>the highest score in this category is Tamil Nadu in the largest States which is already more than aspirational target of this policy. But the present new education policy is  contradictory to the goal of gross enrollment ratio in many ways. to improve the gross enrollment affordability and accessibility to the education is must which is curtailed by this policy and badly affect the poor people. of course to improve the nation  this kind of policy is essential but it should not marginalise the rights of poor people, so it should not be applied universally. the centre and states which has poor gross enrollment ratio would look deeper into the Tamil Nadu model to get benefited.",

18688,cWsxSP3KGvs,"The problem here is that only the students have curiosity, but the teachers they&#39;re supposed to be taught by, aren&#39;t. This then leads to a fixed old poor mindset of the teacher, and then most teachers believe that they&#39;re above all the students of the class and close their minds to anything new. <br>As the time would pass even if the curriculum would be updated, still the students would have a pulling back effect from the teachers. The teachers have to be very curious and open to learning new things every day!",
18689,cWsxSP3KGvs,"Very good efforts taken by you is remarkable and I feel your hearty approach to make this new Education Policy be popular for betterment of students in India which they become the brave citizens of our country, Thanks",

18695,cWsxSP3KGvs,This was a very well put together research. I would have loved it if it talked about how reservation / quota going to work in relation to the new education policy.,
18696,cWsxSP3KGvs,India needs education revolution.  Just end exam oriented approach and other things will fall in place. New education policy really looks game changer. excited,
18697,cWsxSP3KGvs,"A totally wrong analysis. Absolutely rubbish. This video is just a summary of various WhatsApp messages.<br>For example, the opinion that schools are designed to function like factories to find manpower for the factories is fundamentally incorrect. Obviously this channel has NO f**king insight into the fundamentals of pedagogy.<br>Indians have this thing where they blame all the evils of their education system on Macaulay. Can there be a more narcissistic behaviour??!!<br>Now, coming to the NEP, it is an eyewash. There are NO revolutionary or even distinguishing features of the new NEP. Let me elaborate...<br>First, the date of compliance for complete implementation of the NEP is 2040. Get that??!! 20 years. A policy that will be fully implemented only after 20 years, is a failure in whatever it plans to achieve.<br>&quot;PhD professors cannot teach&quot; is the gem regurgitated by the speaker. This sensational claim is NOT from any formal study. It&#39;s just his impression. And it&#39;s wrong on so many levels.<br>The NEP has focused on making &quot;coding&quot; an essential subject from grade 9 onwards. Coding was relevant in 2000-2010. That&#39;s when all the major companies of today came into existence. It&#39;s foolhardy to even assume that the same environment will exist in 2040 and that coding is relevant for the future world. The most stupid decision ever taken in education policy.<br>Also, there is NO attempt in the NEP to reduce the burden on today&#39;s students, make educational institutions more accountable, give more power to the students and their parents or to prepare the students for a world of 20 years from today.<br>There is no revamp of the curriculum except stupid exclusions of Muslim rulers from some texts.<br>There is NO integration of either the industry or the society with the education system, which BTW existed in the traditional gurukul systems.<br>In all, the NEP is the biggest eyewash lemon sold to the Indian populous in the form of redeeming set of changes. There is nothing of substance and shows the inability of Indians to properly upgrade their future generations.<br>To the people running this channel, I am starting to get the impression that your a mouthpiece for the ruling government. In any case, your biased, uninformed take on this and several other issues is doing a great disservice to the nation.<br>I know that you have to earn a living and have to have a job. But doing so by sacrificing future generations is NOT the way to go. If you do these things because you honestly believe in them, then your beyond redemption.<br>All I can say is, please do proper research before churning out filth like this on your channel. If India is to survive, then we HAVE to recognise &amp; accept our shortcomings and take action accordingly.<br>And we don&#39;t have a lot of time. The next 10 years make or break this country.<br>The first step to solve any problem is to admit that there is one.",
18698,cWsxSP3KGvs,So true about teachers..Specially the Phd once...Literally they know nothing about teaching ...,

18810,HFzSK32G4OU,WHICH MIC HAVE U USED IN THIS VIDEO?,
18811,HFzSK32G4OU,Nice thumbnail,
18812,HFzSK32G4OU,"Usually, I like your content but this one has a lot of conjecture. <br>YouTube &amp; YouTube Music are two different apps altogether. YouTube may help you to redirect from a video to its audio platform but that music app still takes up a very very small portion of the market share as compared to Spotify.<br>It wouldn&#39;t matter therefore even if podcasts come under the same umbrella since it is immensely difficult to move a user loyalty from one music app to another unless there is a drastic difference in the offerings.<br><br>They might just end up coexisting.",

18830,HFzSK32G4OU,Good case study. Apple music is available for Android also. Nothing is free with Apple.,
18831,HFzSK32G4OU,"YouTube Premium is way better, we gets YouTube ad-free, background play and picture-in-picture playing along with YT music premium. Both at the cost of one Spotify subscription. Also suggestions and recommendations for music on YT music is as same as Spotify.",
18832,HFzSK32G4OU,RIP Google music,
18833,HFzSK32G4OU,"I&#39;m a DJ i have used almost all music streaming platform, music apps, music softwares etc.<br>Spotify is best platform. It pays less agree but other platforms too pay less. <br>That&#39;s why music streaming is not a guaranteed income source for Musicians.",
18834,HFzSK32G4OU,Youtube has some exclusive collection of music available nowhere else. I have the premium subscription of Youtube and I watch most of this channel&#39;s videos as a podcast by switching off the screen.,
18835,HFzSK32G4OU,That&#39;s why they collabed with Netflix to make the Shows and Movies Albums Spotify exclusive!<br>Just like Apple is doing with Apple TV+ contents on Apple Music,
18836,HFzSK32G4OU,"Apple Music for Apple users only? Dude do you even do your research? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFzSK32G4OU&amp;t=8m08s"">8:08</a>",

18840,HFzSK32G4OU,why don&#39;t you talk in hindi?,
18841,HFzSK32G4OU,I would prefer Spotify over Youtube Music because of the quality of ads. Sometimes there are 10 min long ads. There is not background playing ability. It just feels so bad.,
18842,HFzSK32G4OU,"Thanks to YT&#39;s algorithm, Think School&#39;s videos keep popping up in my suggestions and boy, am I so eager to lap them up! Love your videos as always boss! üëåüèºüëåüèº",

18845,HFzSK32G4OU,Where&#39;s Amazon music,
18846,HFzSK32G4OU,"I disagree that Yt music will come out a winner. I am a premium member of YouTube. The music quality and app experience are abysmal. <br>All the audiophiles prefer Spotify -&gt; Apple Music -&gt; Yt Music.  Apple music shines in ecosys, especially with AirpodsPro.<br>All the YT premium subscribers take the subscription for ad-free video experience, not for the music experience.<br>And Google has a history of killing off its apps.",

18850,HFzSK32G4OU,ngl thumbnail caught me,
18851,HFzSK32G4OU,Good video. I think it would have been nice to mention how many billion dollars Apple made in iPods,
18852,HFzSK32G4OU,Whole Spotify-Joe Rogan fiasco and Apple Music engaging in a bit of trolling would make for a great part 2 in coming months we just don&#39;t know whats gonna happen currently maybe if some big artist pulls their music it&#39;ll be very interesting nonetheless.,
18853,HFzSK32G4OU,Great,
18854,HFzSK32G4OU,"The comparison between Apple music and other music apps is wrong and illogical. Apple music is strictly only for Apple users and rest all apps are for every user. <br>By a far margin, Apple music is the best music app in the world currently in terms of audio output and quality! Apple music is cheaper than Spotify and many other apps but provides best quality audio among all other apps.",
18855,HFzSK32G4OU,"There&#39;s a big issue you did not even touch, and that is yes Napster did change consumer behaviour but the wide scale change was with YouTube.

The US, portugese , france, all left the colonies because of netaji or it was all part of decolnization process. <br>He was no super man military leader who was to defeat to the British India army of the Allied offensive, the INA was moslty an irregular milita with little or no war expertise this was ww2 not some random skirmish.  <br>A regiment of women may sound inspiring but only a fool would use them in direct battle in 1940s.<br>Coming to naval mutiny andRed fort trials, the revolts primarily started because of bad reparations paid to the navy post the war for multitude of reasons. And the mass mobilization was done by guess who? the CPI and Congress (under Aruna Asif ali) the same lot who u are sublty trying to point is reponsible for &quot;hiding&quot; these facts. There is also a memorial in Colaba, Mumbai buiilt to honor this mutiny.<br>It was the Congress defence committe who defended the trio having Nehru and Aruna ali.  All this is well documented and taught at Universtiy level, school textbooks have to fit 150 yrs of history in less than 150 pages.<br>History as other subjects requires people to study at certain depth to understand its aspects, its far more complex than a mere heresay quote (of which there is absolutely no record) of Mr. Attlee",

They said he united India. But many tried to and only he succeeded,  did British let him succeed? Because no ruthless idiot will give away their toys because we asked nicely. I mean they are ruthless, even my kid brain can deduce it, and they certainly not idiots. They manged to divide Indian ppl on bases of many things in just few decades, whereas we lived harmoniously for many centuries. Then came our 10th social teacher who used to get triggered when ever Ghamdhi topic comes. Some times he would burst and scold him straight every saying he is the reason the independence was delayed.<br><br>Later when we learn all these studies, I mean how gullible we have to be or how smart Ghandhi and britishers had to be to fool an entire nation of thinking we got independence because of non violence movement lead by Ghandhi.ü§ê",

However Japanese Army was interested in capturing only North East India as it fit their plan of Greater Asia. Also Naga soldiers who fought the Japanese fondly recall how happy they were to defeat them who left a trail of destruction in Burma and Manipur. This is not surprising as Japanese soldiers were so  brainwashed by Hirohito that this was their trademark style wherever they conquered.<br>If Japanese had won instead, North East India wouldn&#39;t be part of India.

19323,nnwqtZiYMxQ,"I live Mumbai, but, when I came here, about 3 years ago, we started to buy Amul not knowing that the competition was selling far good quality milk at the same price. Previously, I resided in Akola, Maharashtra, where Aarey was selling the same quality milk at 1/2 the rate. So, Amul is just exhausting it&#39;s customers money, and making huge profits by making low quality products.",
19324,nnwqtZiYMxQ,"Amul might be doing good business, but the quality of milk has been continuously worsening. Like here, I live in Mumbai City (District) and the the milk I bought is Amul Taaza (toned). The MRP for the packet of 1/2 litres is 26  but the shopkeepers sell it at 27, some selling for 28 or even 29 rs. And the milk is so thin that it is easily comparable to water. Then, I started buying some alternatives and they offer far superior quality compared to Amul and that too at the same price. So, I request to Amul management team to mind the quality of their products, too.",

19342,nnwqtZiYMxQ,Everything is good...but in lockdown my company which supplies loose and Freshly milked A2 milk increased its volume  hugely as people become more aware about processing industry and moved from packet milk to fresh milk. You may be right on other facts but health benefits on packet milk that&#39;s a question mark. Processing industry can never make a product more healthy. Our traditional way is alwayd better. And I have noticed in bangalore more loose milk seller selling milk after I came in here since last 3 yrs. And all these happened during lockdown. Yes in only smaller area of Bangalore where we supply our dairy products...But this can happen anywhere around the world....,

19399,nnwqtZiYMxQ,the video is irrelevant and read news for some knowledge,
19400,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Excellent video. Two points: 1. Contract farming could still be exploitive as the farmer bears the risk of reduced production and yet selling at lower than market price. During surplus production, &#39;quality&#39; clause is loophole that could be exploited by the buyers to avoid buying all the produce the farmer makes. 2. The lack of legal validity of MSP was supposed to be counterbalanced by a govt buyer, the Food Corporation of India which is assured to be outside Cartals because it is not a private entity. The concept of Govt owned corporation to break monopolies or cartels is used in some countries eg France and is anathema in others eg USA. India belonged to former group with companies like BSNL, FCI, AI etc existing to prevent monopoly and cartelization. The current govt seems  ideologically inclined towards dismantling this model.",

19424,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Wow. First video that helped me understand the importance of the issue.,
19425,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Contract Farming is a norm in the livestock development, at least in Poultry. It happens without any regulation, and they are actually protected to some extent.",
19426,76w6GQ1vs1Y,I am also a Farmer in Maharashtra...and Here is no compulsion to sell produce only in apmc...We usually sell it in our farm...So what govt. Achieve by that provision,
19427,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"Absolutely wonderful video and spot on, Ganesh! However, I have one quick addition/counterpoint to this. Making MSPs a norm for 20 odd crops is practically non-viable for the government since rice and wheat are predominantly the largest in the market. MSP acts as a back-up safety net mechanism if the rates fall well below threshold, and MSP was primarily introduced to reduce the exploitative nature of middlemen and also at a time when India faced acute food shortages. Policies in times of surplus food cannot be the same as back-up plans, which is why the govt. cannot bear the grunt of always ensuring MSP in a time where private players have become inevitable like you said. MSP is usually much higher than market rates tbh, and higher MSP also fuels high crop inflation, thereby hurts economic growth. That said, the trade-off in deciding/regulating the MSP by the govt. for each crop is a ridiculously hard but a necessary task to be done.",

19431,76w6GQ1vs1Y,1st time i understood about farm bill. Thank q,
19432,76w6GQ1vs1Y,If we say APMC has loophole then how that is passed in parliament and being followed now?,
19433,76w6GQ1vs1Y,There is loophole in any new system. if identified find a solution to close it and that&#39;s how every system is evolving. If we thing about only possibilities of loopholes then we end doing nothing and stay with old system for ever. This is will lead to another issue in coming years. So something is better than nothing and keep monitoring any loopholes and block it with amendment.,

19443,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Why did the bill restricted the farmers to seek justice in courts in case of their exploitation? Why is there no MSP gurantee if the prospects are so fruitful? Why the jurisdiction was limited upto an IAS officer? Doesnt that answers the very intent behind the law? Can you analyse what was next to happen with farmers?,

Political party lobbies farmers cannot withstand on the other hand poor farmers have nothing in their hand to bargain and/or balance the unfair Advantages &amp; Leverages Corporates may eventually have in the form of Lifestyle/ Business &amp; Agriculture ecosystem changes which he explained with ola taxi concept <br><br>2) Then farmers may be forced to modify/ upgrade the quality of produce by pursuading to invest in technologies/ machinery equipments thereby to get loans with different incomprehensible interest rates and collateral concepts risking farmers society to severe stress and may cause everything to give up farming and their farm lands to corporates to step in acquiring the land held as collateral thereby opening a Pandora box luring other farmers to sell their land at an attractive price initially &amp; forcing the small and surrounded land owners to sell at very unfair exploitative price...

With these eventualities Risk in mind policy makers and strategists and bureaucrats should give thorough and multiple dimension factors and analysis before giving to corporate lobbyists and media propaganda and hence would need to talk and assure the fearing farmers and explain to them in lay Man terms and then properly drawn out decision should be taken.

19489,76w6GQ1vs1Y,Such great efforts have been put in the video üëèüëèüëè,
19490,76w6GQ1vs1Y,"If govt brings in MSP below which a Pvt company can&#39;t procure farm produce and on the other end if govt regulates the prices at which the companies can sell those produce to the consumers such that there would be ceiling prices above which the produce can&#39;t be sold, there&#39;d be a very little profit margin for the procuring companies. There would be very less scope for such companies to grow as their revenue/profit will remain more or less stagnant over the years. Even taking inflation and thereby according change in MSP and ceiling prices into consideration, the situation doesn&#39;t change much. In such a scenario, why any pvt company would want to participate, as their sole motivation is growing business and making profits, which is being curbed through such policy. A growing profit-making business not only benefits the company owners but also benefits society through increasing employment/wages and indirectly benefits the shareholders of the company as share prices go up. Considering the merits of the proposed amendments in the farm bills as discussed in the video as well as the probable demerits I mentioned above, govt may set up a few companies like IRCTC, IRFC, BSNL etc, which are not exactly profit-oriented as they monopolise (with the exception of BSNL currently) their respective markets to a certain extent. I said a few companies instead of a single company because it would generate limited competition rather than a monopoly in agro produce market as all the companies would have to comply with the govt regulated MSP and ceiling prices but they would have the freedom to set up their own prices within that range. Hence, the freedom to sell and buy depending upon the price/quality of products would also be transferred to the farmers and consumers respectively.",

Anyway, I enjoyed how Jockey completely transformed the market and changed people&#39;s perceptions and stigmas about underwear.
